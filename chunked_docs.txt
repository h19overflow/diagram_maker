Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent abilities in text generation, question answering, and reasoning, facilitating
various tasks and domains. Despite their proficiency in various tasks, LLMs like PaLM 540B and Llama-3.1 405B face limitations due
to large parameter sizes and computational demands, often requiring cloud API use which raises privacy concerns, limits real-time
applications on edge devices, and increases fine-tuning costs. Additionally, LLMs often underperform in specialized domains such as
healthcare and law due to insufficient domain-specific knowledge, necessitating specialized models. Therefore, Small Language Models
(SLMs) are increasingly favored for their low inference latency, cost-effectiveness, efficient development, and easy customization
and adaptability. These models are particularly well-suited for resource-limited environments and domain knowledge acquisition,
addressing LLMs’ challenges and proving ideal for applications that require localized data handling for privacy, minimal inference
latency for efficiency, and domain knowledge acquisition through lightweight fine-tuning. The rising demand for SLMs has spurred
extensive research and development. However, a comprehensive survey investigating issues related to the definition, acquisition,
application, enhancement, and reliability of SLM remains lacking, prompting us to conduct a detailed survey on these topics. The
definition of SLMs varies widely, thus to standardize, we propose defining SLMs by their capability to perform specialized tasks and
suitability for resource-constrained settings, setting boundaries based on the minimal size for emergent abilities and the maximum size
sustainable under resource constraints. For other aspects, we provide a taxonomy of relevant models/methods and develop general
frameworks for each category to enhance and utilize SLMs effectively. We have compiled the collected SLM models and related
methods on GitHub: https://github.com/FairyFali/SLMs-Survey.

1 INTRODUCTION
The evolution of neural language models (LMs) from BERT’s [83] pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm to T5’s [284]
pre-training plus prompting approach, and finally to GPT-3’s [37] pre-training plus in-context learning, has greatly
enhanced natural language processing (NLP). These advancements have broadened NLP’s application across various
fields, including language understanding [350], programming [255, 331], recommendation systems [369], information
retrieval [44, 152, 228, 317], mobile-device control [87], scientific discovery [311, 436], medical question answering
[34, 366], and legal question answering [11]. In particular, the recent emergence of proprietary commercial models
including ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, and open-sourced models such as Llama [94, 338, 339] has led to rapid growth
in the development of large language models (LLMs). Even though neural networks consistently improve on various
tasks with longer training times, larger datasets, and increased model sizes—a phenomenon known as a neural scaling
law [166], these models unpredictably exhibit a sudden acquisition of versatile abilities, termed " emergent ability , "
once they reach a critical scale threshold, thereby supporting the "larger is better" trend. This ability is not present in
small-scale models. For instance, the latest Llama-3.1 model with 405 billion parameters performs better in dialogue,
logical reasoning, and programming compared to the smaller 7B counterpart [94].
Despite their prowess in complex tasks, LLMs’ huge parameters and computational needs impose significant
limitations, hindering their adoption in many real-world applications. For example, the LLaMa 3.1 model with 405 billion
parameters [94], trained on 16K H100 GPUs for 54 days, requires about 202.5 GB of GPU memory using int4 precision
and has large inference latency. These issues present several challenges in specific contexts: (1) LLMs are generally
hosted in the cloud and used via cloud-based APIs due to the large GPU memory and computational cost. Users need to
upload their data to query LLMs, raising data leakage and privacy concerns, especially in high-stake scenarios such as
healthcare, finance, and e-commerce; (2) Driven by personal agents, on-device deployment is a critical requirement.
Several factors, including cloud costs, latency, and privacy concerns, hinder the on-device processing of cloud-based
LLMs, and direct deployment is impractical due to their high parameter and cache requirements, which often exceed the
capabilities of devices such as mobile phones; (3) Their large parameter count can cause inference delays from seconds
to minutes, unsuitable for real-time applications. For instance, Llama 2 7B takes approximately 84 seconds to process
100 tokens on benchmarks including HellaSwag, TruthfulQA, MMLU, and Arc_C when run on a smartphone equipped
with a Snapdragon 685 processor [336]; (4) To boost performance in specialized domains such as healthcare and law,
where generic LLMs underperform, LLMs are often fine-tuned. However, this process is computationally expensive due
to their large size. (5) Though general-purpose LLMs are powerful, many real-world applications require only specific
abilities and domain knowledge, deploying general-purpose LLMs would be a waste of resources and such LLMs often
cannot match the performance of models tailored for specific tasks [52, 125, 156, 275, 369].
Recently, small language models (SLMs) have shown great potential in alleviating these issues while achieving
performance comparable to LLMs for domain-specific problems [1, 26, 116, 143, 223, 274, 333, 336, 402, 439]. Owing to
fewer parameters, SLMs excel in efficiency, cost, flexibility, and customization. They provide significant computational

savings in pre-training and inference with reduced memory and storage needs, which is vital for applications requiring
efficient resource use. These small models are especially effective in resource-limited settings, performing well on
low-power devices such as edge devices. Besides, SLMs improve on-device processing by enhancing privacy, security,
response times, and personalization. This supports advanced personal assistants and cloud-independent applications,
boosting energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. For example, the Llama 3.2 models (1B & 3B) demonstrate
that local processing enables immediate execution of prompts and responses [7]. This approach protects privacy by
keeping sensitive data such as patient health information (PHI), business data, personal messages, and calendar details
local, enhancing confidentiality. It also allows for precise control over which queries are processed on-device versus
those requiring cloud-based models. Therefore, small language models are gaining increasing attention as alternatives
to LLMs, as indicated in Figure 2, which shows that SLMs are downloaded more frequently than larger models in the
Hugging Face community, and Figure 3, which illustrates the growing popularity of SLM releases over time.
Typically, LMs that exhibit emergent abilities are classified as LLMs. However, the categorization of SLMs remains
unclear. Studies vary in their contexts: some define SLMs as models with fewer than one billion parameters [223], while
others consider the term “small language model” relative to the larger counterparts [183, 327, 369], with no consensus on
a unified definition in the current landscape of LLMs. Research suggests SLMs for mobile devices, typically possessing
around 6GB of memory, consist of sub-billion parameter models [ 223], whereas others classify models with up to
10 billion parameters as small, noting their lack of emergent abilities [105]. Given their use in resource-constrained
environments and for specific tasks, we propose a generalized definition: Given specific tasks and resource constraints,
we define SLMs as falling within a range where the lower bound is the minimum size at which the model exhibits emergent
abilities for a specialized task, and the upper bound is the largest size manageable within limited resource conditions. This
definition integrates various perspectives and addresses factors related to mobile computing and capability thresholds.
Due to the growing demand for SLMs, extensive literature has emerged on various aspects of SLMs. For example,
several resource-efficient techniques [398] and training methods optimized for SLMs, such as quantization-aware training
[221, 357, 400] and selective architectural component choices [223, 280, 336], aim to enhance performance in specific
applications [36, 52, 275, 292, 382]. These methods have led to the development of numerous open-source, general-
purpose, and domain-specific SLMs [3, 26, 34, 333, 402, 435]. Beyond their inherent capabilities, SLMs can enhance LLMs
by serving as modules or effective proxies [246, 297, 383, 399, 413, 450]. Furthermore, the complementary advantages of
SLMs and LLMs can be leveraged collectively to better complete tasks [79, 204, 234, 307, 437]. Despite the commendable
performance of SLMs, it is crucial not to overlook their credibility issues, such as the risks of adversarial attacks,
producing hallucinations, and privacy breaches [88, 95, 138, 176, 176, 222, 248, 254, 273, 351, 354, 370, 371, 425, 445].
However, currently, there is no comprehensive survey thoroughly exploring these works on SLMs in the era of LLMs.
Therefore, this paper offers the first comprehensive survey that analyzes various aspects of SLMs in the LLM era and
their future directions. The overview structure of our paper is shown in Figure 1. To summarize, our major contributions

•In Section 3, we examine various techniques for improving the performance of SLMs, including training from scratch,
fine-tuning, knowledge distillation, quantization, and leveraging LLM-enhancing technologies to optimize SLMs.
•In Section 4, we discuss the tasks that SLMs can enhance and the deployment strategies that enable models to fit

labor-intensive fine-tuning, susceptibility to knowledge noise, and risks of copyright infringement.
•In Section 7, we survey two kinds of synergies between LLMs and SLMs: one involves cloud-based LLMs and local

Concurrently with our survey, Lu et al. [229] evaluate open-source SLMs, focusing on their architectures, datasets,
algorithms, and on-device performance metrics such as inference latency and memory usage. Van Nguyen et al .

review with the following differences: (1) we present a detailed taxonomy of recent advancements in SLMs in the era of
LLMs; (2) we define SLMs based on emergent capabilities and device specifications, which refines previous unclear
definitions related to LLMs; (3) we discuss SLM applications, especially in on-device tasks and deployment, topics
previously unexplored; (4) we examine domain-specific SLMs previously overlooked; and (5) we additionally consider
the synergy between SLMs and LLMs.

2 FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS IN BUILDING LANGUAGE MODELS
This section will introduce foundational concepts and background knowledge for language models, including the
concepts of architecture and the training process, as well as methods for obtaining SLMs from LLMs. The advanced
training strategy to improve SLM performance will be introduced in Section 3.
2.1 Architecture of SLMs
2.1 Architecture of SLMs
SLMs commonly employ the Transformer architecture [346] (see Figure 4), which utilizes self-attention mechanisms to
manage long-range text dependencies, essential for maintaining performance with constrained resources. However, due
to the attention mechanism, Transformers have large inference cost. Hence, to alleviate the issue, several subquadratic-
time architectures such as Mamba [ 117], Hymba [90], and xLSTM [ 25] are proposed. Next, we will give details of
Transformer due to its popularity and briefly introduce newly emerged models.

2.1.1 Transformer. The Transformer’s self-attention mechanism [346] allows
language models to efficiently capture contextual information across longer
sequences, even with limited resources. The Transformer generally adopts an
encoder-decoder structure featuring self-attention mechanisms, feedforward
networks, positional embeddings, and layer normalization. The Transformer
architecture design tailored for SLMs is detailed in Section 5; this section will
provide only foundational concepts.
Self-Attention Mechanism enables the model to evaluate the importance
of tokens relative to each other. The self-attention mechanism is written as
Attention(Q,K,V)= softmax
 
QK⊤
√︁
𝑑𝑘
!
V
where Q, K, and V are query, key, and value matrices, scaled by
√︁
𝑑𝑘 for stability
where 𝑑𝑘 is the dimension of key matrices. The dot product QK⊤reflects the
similarity between the query and key vectors.
Multi-Head Attention (MHA) [ 346] is the first method that uses multiple
heads to capture diverse information. MHA allows the model to attend to different
parts of the input sequence using multiple attention heads as
MultiHead(Q,K,V)= Concat(head1,head2,..., headℎ)W𝑂, with head𝑖 = Attention(QW𝑄
𝑖 ,KW𝐾
𝑖 ,VW𝑉
𝑖 ) (1)
Each head in the Multi-Head Attention mechanism operates independently, allowing the model to capture diverse
aspects of the data. The outputs are combined using learned projection matrices W𝑄
𝑖 , W𝐾
𝑖 , and W𝑉
𝑖 , concatenated, and
passed through the output projection matrix W𝑂.
passed through the output projection matrix W𝑂.
Building on this foundation, several modifications have been introduced to further optimize self-attention mechanisms
for specific challenges such as memory efficiency and computational speed. To address the KV-cache bottleneck in
MHA, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) [ 303] proposes that all attention heads share the same set of keys and values,
which reduces the memory and computational overhead associated with storing and managing multiple key-value pairs.
Grouped Query Attention (GQA) [ 8] serves as a middle ground between MHA and MQA. It introduces subgroups of
query heads (fewer than the total number of attention heads), where each subgroup shares a single key and value head.

A Survey of Small Language Models 7
Unlike MQA and GQA, which reduce the number of key and value heads,Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) [ 211]
compresses the keys and values into a joint latent vector. This compression allows for efficient handling of key-value
pairs while maintaining high performance, significantly reducing the KV-cache and improving inference efficiency.
Flash Attention [73, 74] accelerates the self-attention mechanism by minimizing the memory overhead typical of
standard attention calculations. This optimization allows SLMs to process longer sequences more efficiently, enhancing
their functionality under strict hardware constraints.
Feedforward Network (FFN) comprises two linear transformations separated by a non-linearity, typically modeled
as FFN(x) = 𝜎(xW1 +𝑏1)W2 +𝑏2. where W1 and W2 are the weight matrices, and 𝑏1 and 𝑏2 are bias terms. 𝜎
is the activation function, which introduces non-linearity, allowing models to learn complex patterns. Generally,
ReLU is used as the activation function. In addition to ReLU, activation functions such as GeLU and SiLU are also
used in SLMs to improve performance. We give the details here: (i)ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) [ 5] is defined as
𝜎(𝑥)= max(0,𝑥), which is commonly used for its simplicity and effectiveness. (ii) GELU (Gaussian Error Linear
Unit) [135] is defined as GELU(𝑥)= 𝑥 ·Φ(𝑥)= 𝑥 ·1

for better gradient flow control. Since calculating the Gaussian error function for each neuron is computationally
expensive and time-consuming, there are approximations using tanh and sigmoid functions, corresponding toGELUtanh
and SiLU: (iii) GELU with tanh is defined as GELUtanh (𝑥) = 0.5 ·𝑥 ·

SiLU(𝑥)= 𝑥 ·sigmoid(𝑥)= 𝑥 · 1
1+𝑒−𝑥 . It effectively combines the sigmoid function with its input, enhancing modeling
capabilities. (v) SwiGLU (Swish-Gated Linear Units) [304] integrates the Swish activation function with Gated Linear
Units, defined as SwiGLU(𝑥)= Swish(𝑥 ·𝑊 +𝑏)⊙( 𝑥 ·𝑉 +𝑐)where 𝑊,𝑉 are the weight matrix and 𝑏,𝑐 are the bias
terms. The Swish function is expressed as Swish(𝑥)= 𝑥 ·sigmoid(𝑥). This combination enhances expressiveness and
computational efficiency, making it a preferred choice in advanced models such as the Qwen series [402].
Positional Embeddings in Transformer models [346] are essential for capturing token order, providing context
about relative positions within a sequence. Traditional positional embeddings in the Transformer architecture utilize
a sinusoidal function, defined as: 𝑃𝐸(𝑝𝑜𝑠,2𝑖)= sin
 𝑝𝑜𝑠
 𝑝𝑜𝑠

, 𝑃𝐸 (𝑝𝑜𝑠,2𝑖+1)= cos
 𝑝𝑜𝑠
100002𝑖/𝑑model

where 𝑝𝑜𝑠
represents the position within the sequence, 𝑖 is the dimension index, and 𝑑model is the dimensionality of the model. To
improve the model’s capacity for understanding the relative positions of tokens within a sequence, Rotary Positional
Embedding (RoPE) [ 318] introduces a rotational matrix to the embeddings. RoPE significantly enhances the positional
encoding by maintaining the relative distances through rotational transformations, thus optimizing the model’s
interpretative ability regarding sequence dynamics.
Layer Normalization [ 185] stabilizes the training process by normalizing layer outputs, accelerating convergence.
Two types of layer normalization are commonly used [185]: (i) Non-Parametric Layer Norm normalizes inputs using
the mean and variance calculated across the layer’s dimensions without learnable parameters asLN(𝑥)= 𝑥−𝜇
𝜎 where 𝜇is
𝜎 where 𝜇is
the mean and𝜎is the standard deviation of the inputs. Its simplicity makes it ideal for SLMs. (ii)Parametric Layer Norm
includes learnable parameters 𝛾 and 𝛽for adaptive scaling and bias, enhancing model flexibility: PLN(𝑥)= 𝛾

2.1.2 Mamba. The attention mechanism in Transformer suffers from
a drawback: it requires recalculating attention scores with every pre-
vious token for each new token generated during inference, leading
to quadratic time complexity. This increases the inference cost as
sequence lengths grow. In contrast, Mamba [75, 117], based on state
space models (SSMs) [164] which are a superclass of recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), rely only on the last hidden state for generating the
next token, enabling faster inference speeds, as shown in Figure 5. To
address the Linear Time Invariant nature of traditional SSMs, which
hinders their ability to focus on or ignore specific inputs, Mamba
improves SSMs with a dynamic selection mechanism. This mechanism selectively filters out irrelevant information
while retaining essential data, tailored to the content of the input. Leveraging this selective SSM foundation, Mamba
adeptly captures complex global relationships within sequence data. Due to its focus on the immediate previous hidden
state, as opposed to Transformer which requires access to all previous hidden states, Mamba achieves a higher utilization
rate of model parameters. This makes it more suitable for SLMs. However, we identify two drawbacks of Mamba: (i)
its focus on selectively capturing global information may compromise performance on tasks that require nuanced
understanding, such as detailed sentiment analysis or complex entity recognition; and (ii) to balance inference speed,
Mamba’s recurrent structure primarily encodes static global information, which limits its effectiveness in handling
multi-round tasks within a single query, such as interactive dialogue systems or iterative problem-solving scenarios.
In language modeling, Mamba 1 [117] is pre-trained on the Pile dataset [108] using the training recipe from [37] and
ranges from 125M to 1.3B parameters. It outperforms comparable models such as Pythia [31] and RWKV [270] in various
tasks; for instance, Mamba-1.4B achieves a 32.8% accuracy on the Arc-Challenge [65] dataset, surpassing Pythia-1.4B’s
28.5% and RWKV-1.5B’s 29.4%. Mamba 2 [75] develops a theoretical framework linking SSMs with attention mechanisms
through structured semi-separable matrices, enhancing the selective SSM to achieve 2-8x faster speeds while competing
with Transformer models. Training and configuration for Mamba 2 align with Mamba 1. Additionally, Mamba-series
models are applied widely across different fields [160, 280, 281, 463]. Other follow-up Mamba-based language models
such as Falcon Mamba 7B [463] and Mistral 7B [160] also demonstrate the efficiency of the architecture for NLP tasks.
Falcon Mamba 7B scales Mamba’s long-sequence processing capabilities to extensive language data, reducing memory
overhead and making it ideal for long-form NLP tasks. Similarly, Mistral 7B incorporates Mamba’s efficient sequence
handling ability to improve processing speed and computational efficiency in long-context NLP tasks, showcasing
Mamba’s scalability and practicality for large-scale language modeling.

heads and the contextual summarization of SSMs, increasing the model’s flexibility and expressiveness in managing
diverse information flows and memory access patterns.
Hymba has been developed in models of varying sizes—125M, 350M, and 1.5B, trained on a combination of the
DCLM-Baseline-1.0 [192], SmolLM-Corpus [27], and a proprietary high-quality dataset, with token counts of 1 trillion,
250 billion, and 50 billion, respectively. The models incorporate the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler
[143] and the data annealing technique [94] to ensure stable pretraining, conducted on 128 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. The
1.5B base model was post-trained using full finetuning (FFT), followed by direct preference optimization (DPO) [283] to
develop the Hymba-1.5B-Instruct model. In commonsense reasoning tasks, the Hymba 1.5B model surpasses Llama-
3.2-3B [7] by achieving 1.32% higher average accuracy, requiring an 11.67×smaller cache size, and delivering a 3.49×
increase in processing speed.
2.1.4 xLSTM. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [ 137] shares a conceptual similarity with Mamba that achieves
success in language modeling through the introduction of time-dependent weights. This similarity raises an intriguing
question: how effective would LSTMs be at language modeling if scaled to billions of parameters, incorporating
advanced techniques from modern LLMs while addressing known LSTM limitations? Inspired by this question, Beck
et al. [25] propose xLSTM architecture, which performs favorably compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and SSMs
in empirical evaluations. To address the limitations of LSTM, xLSTM designs exponential gates to enhance effectiveness
with long sequences, expand memory cells from scalars to matrices to increase storage capacity, and remove memory

mixing to enable parallel processing.
To test the language modeling capabilities of xLSTM scaled to billions of parameters, it is trained on a large dataset
comprising 300 billion tokens from SlimPajama [ 314] across various model sizes (125M, 350M, 760M, 1.3B). The
performance of pre-trained xLSTM is compared against RWKV-4 [270], Llama [153], and Mamba [117] across 571 text
domains of the PALOMA benchmark [237] and various downstream tasks. Across all model sizes and the majority of
tasks, xLSTM consistently outperforms the others, suggesting that larger xLSTM models could become formidable
competitors to existing Large Language Models that utilize Transformer technology.
2.2 Training SLMs from Scratch
Training SLMs from scratch entails several critical steps: (i) Pre-training, focused on acquiring general features and
knowledge from the corpus; (ii) Fine-tuning, targeted at boosting the model’s abilities and performance for specific tasks;
(iii) Decoding strategies, which involve the methods used for iteratively selecting the next token during generation.
2.2.1 Pre-training. Typically, the pre-training paradigm for language models is divided into encoder-based and decoder-
based approaches. Encoder-based models, such as BERT [83], utilize Masked Language Modeling (MLM) tasks where
the goal is to predict masked tokens within a sentence. This is achieved by maximizing:
𝑃(masked token |context)= softmax(W ·hmask +𝑏),
𝑃(masked token |context)= softmax(W ·hmask +𝑏),
where masked token is the original token that has been masked, context represents the other unmasked tokens in the
sentence, W and 𝑏are trainable parameters of a linear output layer, hmask is the output from the transformer encoder
for the masked position, and softmax is the activation function that converts logits to probabilities over the vocabulary.
This process enhances the model’s language encoding capabilities. Decoder-based models, such as GPT [282], employ
Manuscript submitted to ACM
10 Fali Wang, et al.
Next Token Prediction (NTP) tasks, aiming to model the distribution of the next token by maximizing:
𝑃(next token |context)= softmax(W ·hlast +𝑏),
where next token is the token that the model aims to predict, context represents the sequence of tokens preceding the
token to be predicted, and hlast is the output from the transformer encoder for the last token in the context. Effective
data preprocessing, crucial for optimizing the performance of SLMs trained from scratch, involves meticulous data
cleaning and strategic tokenization.
Data Cleaning involves techniques such as filtering, deduplication, and noise reduction, which improve data quality
and help the model generalize better. Filtering noisy or irrelevant data, addressing outliers, and handling imbalances in
the dataset ensure that the training data is both representative and efficient. Deduplication, in particular, helps prevent
overfitting by removing repeated instances, making the model more robust with efficient parameter usage.
Tokenization plays a vital role in handling diverse vocabularies without increasing model size. Advanced methods
such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) [ 106] and WordPiece [316] break text into subwords [83], allowing the model to
manage rare and compound words efficiently. These strategies ensure that SLMs maintain a balance between vocabulary
coverage and model compactness, crucial for improving generalization while minimizing computational demands.
2.2.2 Fine-Tuning. After the initial training, SLMs are fine-tuned on specific tasks using task-specific data and loss
functions. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods [118, 140, 142, 199], such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), prefix-
tuning, and adapter modules, are particularly effective for SLMs. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [ 142] modifies
Transformer weights by introducing trainable low-rank matrices A and B for efficient fine-tuning, avoiding significant
alterations to pre-trained weights. The update is represented as: ΔW = AB⊤The fine-tuned weight matrix used
in Transformer operations then becomes: Wft = W +𝛼ΔW where 𝛼 is a scaling factor adjusting the adaptation’s
impact, allowing fine-tuning on a smaller set of parameters while retaining the model’s foundational capabilities.
Prefix-Tuning [199] prepends learnable prefixes to the input sequence, guiding the model’s attention without altering
core model parameters. It is especially useful for generative tasks. Adapter Modules [ 140] are small, trainable layers
inserted into the pre-trained model. These layers are fine-tuned on task-specific data, allowing the base model to
remain fixed while the adapters learn the necessary adjustments. The typical structure of an adapter module includes a
down-projection, a non-linearity, and an up-projection: Adapter(h)= h +Wup ·𝜎(Wdown ·h +bdown)+bup where
h is the input hidden state, Wdown and Wup are the projection matrices, bdown and bup are the bias terms, and 𝜎 is a
non-linear activation function.
2.2.3 Decoding Strategies. After pre-training or fine-tuning, employing an effective decoding strategy is crucial for
generating output from language models. Decoding, the process of text generation from SLMs, involves iteratively
selecting the next word. A fundamental method is the greedy search, which predicts the most likely token at each step.
This is formally modeled as: 𝑥𝑖 = arg max𝑥 𝑃(𝑥 |𝑥<𝑖), where 𝑥𝑖 is the token with the highest probability at the 𝑖-th
step, conditioned on the preceding context 𝑥<𝑖. Other decoding strategies, such as beam search or top-k sampling, are
crucial for generating high-quality outputs. Beam search balances exploration and exploitation by considering multiple
possible sequences simultaneously, while top-k sampling introduces diversity and creativity in text generation. These
strategies collectively ensure that SLMs are efficient and capable of delivering high performance across various natural
language processing tasks.

2.3 Obtain SLMs from LLMs
Obtaining an SLM from an LLM is crucial for deploying in resource-constrained environments. Instead of training from
scratch, leveraging an LLM allows for knowledge transfer, enabling SLMs to retain much of the LLM’s linguistic and
domain knowledge with reduced training time and data. To obtain SLMs from LLMs, three primary techniques are used:
pruning, knowledge distillation, and quantization. Pruning removes less critical parameters, reducing model size while
aiming to maintain performance. Knowledge distillation transfers knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller
student model, preserving much of the original model’s understanding. Quantization decreases parameter precision,
significantly lowering memory and computation needs with minimal impact on accuracy. These methods balance size
reduction, efficiency, and performance retention.

(b) Structured Pruning(a) Unstructured Pruning

Fig. 7. Unstructured and structured pruning.
2.3.1 Pruning. Pruning is a technique used to reduce a model’s size and
computational requirements (e.g., LLMs) without significantly sacrificing
its performance [126]. This process involves identifying and removing less
important or redundant parameters and components from the model. The
primary goal of LLM pruning is to make the model more efficient, faster, and
suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Typically,
pruning can be categorized into two main types: unstructured pruning and
structured pruning . An illustration of unstructured pruning and structured
pruning is shown in Figure 7.
Unstructured Pruning [76, 102, 201, 300, 321, 438, 442] prunes an LLM by removing weights individually without
considering its internal structure. The least significant parameters are pruned according to specific criteria (e.g. magnitude
or impact on the output). This method can achieve significant compression while maintaining performance. However,
it can also lead to irregular memory access patterns and reduced hardware efficiency because the pruned model lacks a
regular structure. SparseGPT [102] is a representative unstructured pruning method that can reduce large-scale GPT
models like OPT-175B [440] and BLOOM-176B [181] to up to 60% sparsity using a novel sparse regression solver. Wanda
[321] combines weight magnitudes with input activations to efficiently identify and discard less impactful parameters.
It operates in a single forward pass, rapidly achieving high sparsity without retraining. It is also worth noting that
recent studies specifically address the compatibility issues between pruning and Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) [142],
such as LoRAPrune [438].
such as LoRAPrune [438].
Structured Pruning [13, 19, 51, 110, 124, 188, 196, 232, 243, 305, 306, 385, 410, 446], which prunes an LLM by
targeting entire structural components—such as neurons, channels, or layers—rather. This approach allows for a direct
reduction in dimensionality, thus efficiently reducing model complexity and memory usage. Although structured pruning
may lead to higher accuracy degradation than unstructured pruning, it simplifies implementation without requiring
specialized hardware. ShortGPT [ 243] proposes the Block Influence (BI) metric, which measures the significance
of each layer based on its transformation of hidden states. Essentially, a transformer block’s influence is measured
by how much it alters the hidden states. By calculating BI scores, ShortGPT determines which layers contribute
minimally to the overall performance and removes these low-importance layers. This simple yet effective layer removal
strategy significantly reduces the model’s parameters and computational requirements. LLM Pruner [ 232] offers a
method to efficiently prune LLMs without access to the original training dataset. It employs a three-step compression
pipeline: Discovery (identifying interdependent structures), Estimation (evaluating the performance impact of each
group), and Recovery (post-training to address performance loss). NutePrune [196] enhances structured pruning with a

Numerous-teacher method, employing variable sparsity masks and LoRA modules to guide the pruning process. This
approach effectively reduces model size and complexity. COST-EFF [305] introduces a slenderized backbone—a form
of structured pruning—and a multi-exit model that employs task-specific calibration through knowledge distillation.
This slenderization reduces the model’s spatial footprint, while the multi-exit strategy effectively balances utility and
runtime costs. To enhance the flexibility of structural pruning, DISP-LLM [110] breaks the structural dependencies in
regular methods by allowing different layers to have different subsets of features along the embedding dimension.
2.3.2 Knowledge Distillation. Knowledge distillation (KD) compresses a larger teacher model into a smaller student
model by training the student to mimic the teacher’s outputs [ 136]. This enables the student to retain much of the
teacher’s capabilities with fewer parameters, making it ideal for scaling down LLMs for resource-limited environments
while maintaining performance. KD can be categorized into white-box and black-box approaches [361, 403, 457] as
shown in Figure 8. In White-Box KD, the student has access to the teacher’s internal states or output distributions
[6, 119, 157, 169, 173, 265, 381, 434]. Generalized Knowledge Distillation (GKD) [173] introduces skew KL divergence to
stabilize gradients and enhance performance, using an adaptive off-policy approach to minimize noisy feedback and
improve efficiency.Black-Box KD relies only on teacher outputs without having access to model internals [48, 182, 271,
360]. Methods like Distilling Step-by-Step [141] use teacher-generated rationales to train smaller models, improving
performance with fewer examples. LaMini-LM [380] creates a diverse instruction dataset with GPT-3.5 Turbo responses,
enabling robust performance in smaller models.

2.3.3 Quantization. Quantization reduces the storage and computational demands of LLMs by converting floating-
point representations into lower-precision formats, significantly cutting both storage requirements and computational
complexity. Existing methods fall into two categories:Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT). Figure 9 illustrates the two quantization methods.Post-Training Quantization, applied after training, simplifies
model compression without altering the architecture or requiring retraining, though it may result in precision loss.
Consider a group or block of weights w; the linear operation can be expressed as𝑦 = wx, while the quantized version is
given by𝑦 = 𝑄(w)x. Generally, the quantization function𝑄is defined as [207]: 𝑄(w)= Δ·Round  w
Δ
 , Δ = max(|w|)
2𝑁 −1 ,
where 𝑁 is the number of quantization bits, and Δ is the quantization scale factor determined by the absolute maximum
value of w. Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) enhances LLM efficiency by directly incorporating quantization
into the training process, often resulting in higher accuracy than PTQ. During QAT, the forward pass utilizes quantized
weights 𝑄(W)and activations 𝑄(X), while retaining full-precision values during the backward pass and for updating
gradients to ensure stable learning dynamics. The comparisons of the post-training quantization methods are summarized
in Table 1, detailing precision, addressed problems, and technical contributions of each method.
2.3.4 Low-Rank Techniques. Low-rank techniques compress LLMs by approximating a high-dimensional weight matrix
with two lower-dimensional matrices, reducing computational and memory requirements. A matrix W ∈R𝑚×𝑛 is
approximated as W ≈A ×B, where A ∈R𝑚×𝑟 and B ∈R𝑟×𝑛, with 𝑟 much smaller than 𝑚or 𝑛, reducing the number
of parameters. Building on this concept, Ji et al. [158] propose a low-rank method tailored for LLMs, leveraging the
observation that while LLMs have high-rank weights, their feature interactions tend to exhibit low-rank properties. The
method estimates feature distributions using pooled covariance matrices and allocates distinct compression ratios to
layers based on their sensitivity to low-rank compression. A Bayesian optimization strategy, using a Gaussian process
as the surrogate model, optimizes the allocation of low-rank dimensions, ensuring the model maintains performance
while achieving significant compression. Transitioning from model compression to fine-tuning, Cho et al. [62] tackles
system and data heterogeneity with the HETLORA method, which uses heterogeneous low-rank approximations to
accommodate the diverse capabilities of clients and data complexities. By combining local rank self-pruning with sparsity-
weighted aggregation, it balances high and low-rank LoRA modules, improving convergence speed and performance
compared to uniform approaches. LLM-Neo [409] combines knowledge distillation with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to
improve the efficiency of transferring knowledge from a teacher LLM to a compact student model.

3 ADVANCED ENHANCEMENT STRATEGIES FOR SMALL LANGUAGE MODELS
With the foundational concepts introduced in Section 2, this section explores various advanced techniques that enhance
the performance of SLMs, including innovative training methods for training SLMs from scratch, supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) to align SLMs to adhere to instructions, advanced knowledge distillation and quantization techniques, and
techniques frequently used in LLMs such as mixture-of-experts to enhance SLM for specific applications. A summary of
enhancement techniques is also summarized in Table 2.
3.1 Innovative Training Methods for Small Language Models from Scratch
In scenarios with limited resources, we aim to train small language models to provide efficient, cost-effective solutions
tailored for specific domains, while still maintaining competitive performance with larger models. Training small
language models (SLMs) from scratch involves unique strategies that diverge significantly from those used for large
language models (LLMs). This section synthesizes cutting-edge techniques tailored to optimize the inherent capabilities
of SLMs, underscoring their potential to match or surpass larger counterparts in efficiency and effectiveness. As shown
in Figure 10, the methods for training SLMs from scratch can be categorized into three primary categories: Architecture
Design, Data Construction , and Optimization Strategy . Next, we introduce each category in detail.
Architecture Design for SLMs When designing SLM architectures, parameter-sharing techniques are employed to
minimize space usage and reduce the model’s size. As shown in the first part of Figure 10, parameter sharing is achieved
by two approaches: (i) a single Feed-Forward Network (FFN) module is shared by every transformer layer. As shown in
Figure 10 (1) middle, FFN layer sharing/reusing can maintain a smaller size while still benefiting from the depth and
complexity gained through repeated processing of input data. This technique is firstly applied in MobiLlama [336] which
surpasses the performance of existing SLMs of comparable size. (ii) Entire transformer blocks are shared. As shown in

Figure 10 (1) right, Transformer Block-wise Sharing is another parameter-sharing approach that maintains depth
and complexity. There are different transformer block-wise sharing strategies such as repeating the transformer blocks
all over again or repeating the immediate transformer block. This technique is applied in MobileLLMs [ 223] which
has 125M and 350M parameters. MobileLLMs demonstrate performance improvements of 2.7% and 4.3%, respectively,
compared to previous models with equivalent parameters. Moreover, they exhibit accuracy comparable to LLaMa-2-7B
on API call tasks, highlighting the capabilities of smaller models in mobile environments.
Data Construction For SLMs, the emphasis on data quality surpasses that of quantity and diversity [412]. Experi-
ments demonstrate that using a quality filtering approach to remove low-quality data can lead to improved performance
in SLMs [412]. Unlike large models, which can handle diverse and large datasets, SLMs benefit more from cleaner,
high-quality data probably due to their limited capacity against noise. Generally, data processing has several steps:
(i) Remove HTML, CSS, JS, and non-text elements for clean text; (ii) Filter low text-to-content ratio web pages; (iii)
Deduplicate using SimHash [77, 293]; (iv) Exclude sensitive/offensive content with heuristics and token replacements; (v)
Remove self-repeating phrases of advertisements to enhance dataset informativeness [47, 412]. These steps collectively
ensure that training data has high-quality, informative texts. SLMs also significantly benefit from these techniques. For
example, MindLLMs [412], which are bilingual lightweight language models (available in 1.3B and 3B versions), adopt
these data processing techniques and achieve improved capability acquisition.
Training Strategy for SLMs For LLMs, due to the large model size and data volume, LLMs are usually trained with
one round. For SLMs, multiple-round training can be applied [328]. Considering some examples are hard to fit, hard
examples can be trained with a high probability [ 328]. For each round of training, the data sampling probability is
updated according to the overall loss of that sample. Experiments results show that two rounds of training and a 50%
sampling rate are a good trade-off between performance and training efficiency. Tang et al. [328] show that a deep and
thin neural architecture and multiple-round training can enhance the performance of the trained Pangu 1.5B pro model.
This model outperforms the conventionally trained Pangu 1.5B and a series of other comparable large language models
with similar model sizes on multiple benchmark datasets, achieving an average performance increase of 8.87%.

3.2 Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for Enhancing SLM performance
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) employs a training methodology similar to pre-training but is specifically tailored to
align models to adhere to the instructions encapsulated within various instructional datasets. This approach is designed
to refine the model’s responsiveness and appropriateness to given contexts as dictated by the training data. For example,
various models, such as Alpaca [ 329], UltraChat [86], WizardLM [392], SlimOrca [203], ShareGPT [356], Capybara
[72], Deita [216], and MetaMathQA [420], incorporates a suite of conversational datasets to enhance their capabilities
in context-aware dialogue and instruction adherence. Usually, as shown in Figure 11, existing SFT methods can be
categorized into three categories:
•(i) Classical fine-tuning with downstream data [83, 282] trains SLMs on task-specific annotated data, transferring
general language representations to specific tasks such as sentiment analysis. In the LLM era, this approach remains
effective, such as enhancing LLMs by calibrating responses or assigning risk scores with smaller models such as
BERT [450], or optimizing for mobile devices with MobileBERT [322].
•(ii) Instruction tuning with LLM-generated data [86, 203, 329] or human-generated questions with LLM annotations
[356] aims to align generative models with specific instructions, enhancing their instruction-following and reasoning
capabilities. For example, Alpaca 7B [329] uses 52k ChatGPT-generated instruction-following examples from 175
self-instructed seed tasks to tune Llama 7B [338]. Meanwhile, StableLM [26, 340] is trained on the Restruct-v1 dataset,
which includes summarization, question-answering, and sentiment analysis tasks, using instruction data from [226].
•(iii) Preference optimization with human feedback [264, 283, 356] aims to better align language models with
human preferences. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [264] gathers human-preferred data,
trains a reward model, and fine-tunes the LM using reinforcement learning. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
[283] provides a simpler alternative to RLHF. Unlike RLHF, DPO avoids explicit reward modeling and reinforcement
learning techniques. Instead, it adjusts the log probabilities of preferred versus non-preferred responses using a
dynamic weighting mechanism, preventing model degradation issues typical of methods relying on probability ratios.
For instance, Llama 3.2 1B & 3B apply SFT and DPO in post-training to enhance alignment with instructions and
human preferences.

3.3 Data Quality in Knowledge Distillation (KD)
Transitioning from the discussion on training SLMs from scratch, this section delves into the critical role of data quality
in Knowledge Distillation (KD). The motivation here is to highlight how high-quality data generated from LLMs can
significantly enhance the learning efficiency and performance of SLMs. The central idea is that meticulously crafted
datasets when used in KD, enable SLMs to more effectively mimic the advanced capabilities of their larger counterparts.
As shown in Figure 12, the data can come either from (1) other strong LLMs (e.g., GPT-4 [2]) which are much larger and
more powerful than the target SLM, or (2) the target SLM itself.
Augment Data from LLMs. LLM-generated data could be categorized as pre-training data and fine-tuning data .
Firstly, due to the limitations of model size, studies have shown that training SLMs requires simple and comprehensible
data [96, 183, 187, 384]. As shown in Figure 12 (1) left, TinyStory [96] shows that small models (tens of millions
of parameters) can generate coherent stories for 3-4-year-olds. GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 [2] prompts create simple stories
from three keywords chosen from a 1,500-word vocabulary, which are then used to train SLMs for similar outputs.
This approach shows that simple and comprehensible data can help smaller models exhibit behaviors similar to those
of larger language models, such as obeying scaling laws and achieving enhanced performance. On the other hand,
many efforts to enhance the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capabilities of small models involve using LLMs to generate
high-quality fine-tuning CoT data. As shown in Figure 12 (1) right, these data train small models end-to-end to mimic
CoT reasoning [235, 384]. AS-ES Learning [384] highlights that small models struggle with complex reasoning, even
when provided detailed steps, as these require nuanced extraction and abstraction. Therefore, the study introduces a
paradigm splitting reasoning into extractive segments (context reminders) and abstractive segments (inferred insights).
Augment Data from Itself. Besides distilling data from other LLMs, language models can also train on their own
outputs [29, 145, 337]. Since voting strategies can improve the performance of LLMs, reasoning paths that lead to the
majority answer can be further utilized to fine-tune LLMs [145]. Similarly, SLMs can generate their training data with
the aid of existing rationale generation methods. Self-Amplify [29] notes that human annotation of Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) data is very time-consuming; thus, automated rationale generation methods have been proposed. These methods

3.4 Distillation Techniques for Enhancing SLM Performance
Following the discussion on data quality in KD, this section reviews specialized KD training strategies designed to
enhance the performance of SLMs. The motivation is to address the unique challenges and constraints involved in
distilling knowledge from LLMs to SLMs, ensuring that the smaller models can maximize their performance gains. As
shown in Figure 13, two main gaps between LLMs and SLMs lead to challenges in distillation:distribution mismatch and
domain gap . Distribution mismatch [6, 173] occurs when the distribution of output sequences during training does not
align with the distribution of sequences that SLMs produce during inference, leading to suboptimal performance of the
student model. The domain gap [414] arises when there is a discrepancy between the domains or tasks on which the
LLMs and SLMs are trained and applied. This gap can cause significant degradation in the performance of the student
model if not properly addressed during the distillation process. To address these issues, specialized strategies involve
first aligning the teacher and student models with the target domain before proceeding with knowledge distillation. To
explore these challenges further, we now delve into the details of these two branches of methods.
Distribution Mismatch In original knowledge distillation, illustrated in Figure 13 Distribution Mismatch (a),
the teacher and student are provided with the same input sequences 𝑥 and output labels 𝑦, producing probability
distributions for the next token ( 𝑞 and 𝑝). The loss is calculated as the difference between these two distributions,
𝐷(𝑞,𝑝). However, a key challenge arises due to distribution mismatch: the output sequences during training (𝑦) differ in
distribution from those the SLMs produce during inference (𝑦′). To address this challenge, various techniques have been
proposed. As shown in Figure 13 Distribution Mismatch (b), one approach trains the student model using on-policy
sequences—sequences generated by the student itself—guided by the teacher model’s feedback. Specifically, both the
student and teacher take the same input (𝑥) and the student-generated output (𝑦′), producing probability distributions

A Survey of Small Language Models 19
for the next token ( 𝑞 and 𝑝, respectively). The loss is calculated as the difference between these two distributions,
𝐷(𝑞,𝑝). This approach helps the student model reduce the distribution gap between training and inference by learning
from the teacher’s feedback on its own generated sequences. Generalized Knowledge Distillation ( GKD) [6] is the
first work using this technique and improves distillation outcomes. However, a drawback of this technique is that
it requires the student to constantly produce new training sequences, which can be computationally expensive. To
improve efficiency, as shown in Figure 13 Distribution Mismatch (c), an adaptive off-policy approach can be used to
efficiently manage student-generated outputs by storing them in a replay buffer, thereby reducing computational costs.
DistiLLM [173] employs this off-policy approach and improves the efficiency of KD.
Domain Gap When training an SLM in a specific domain that differs from the domain of the LLMs, the gap between
the two domains becomes problematic. As illustrated in Figure 13 Domain Gap (a), domain adaptation fine-tunes a
language model, initially trained on a general corpus, using a specialized dataset such as PubMed to enhance performance
in that specific domain. As illustrated in Figure 13 Domain Gap (b), Knowledge distillation transfers knowledge from
the larger model to the smaller one. However, because the teacher model may not produce high-quality outputs on
specialized datasets, domain adaptation is needed prior to knowledge distillation. As illustrated in Figure 13 Domain
Gap (c), Adapt-and-Distill [414] tackles the domain gap by distilling general large models into smaller ones. This
paper introduces AdaLM and demonstrates that the “Adapt-and-Distill” strategy—first involving domain adaptation
of both the large teacher model and the small student model, followed by distillation—is the most effective compared
to three other strategies: training directly from scratch, distillation followed by adaptation, and adapting the teacher
model before distillation into a general small student model. These innovative techniques are crucial for enhancing the
capabilities of SLMs, making them more efficient and effective for various applications. However, adapting both the
teacher (LLMs) and the student (SLMs) models to the target domain can be time-consuming. Future research could
focus on efficiently solving the domain gap problem.
Insights: Here are some insights from distillation techniques:
•Sampling SLM outputs during the training process is the main approach to resolving distribution mismatch.
•Techniques like Adapt-and-Distill address the domain gap by first adapting both the teacher (LLMs) and the
student (SLMs) models to the target domain before proceeding with distillation.
3.5 Performance Improvement through Quantization
As mentioned in Section 2, quantization is one of the most effective methods for adapting LLMs to SLMs. However, com-
pression to smaller sizes often compromises performance. To address the performance drop associated with quantization,
various methods have been proposed. This section examines how these quantization methods specifically enhance
the performance of SLMs. While the general introduction to compression methods is discussed in the compression
section, the focus here is on detailing those approaches that boost the efficiency and effectiveness of SLMs. As shown in
Figure 9, we categorize these quantization methods into two main approaches: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), where
quantization is conducted on a well-trained fixed model, and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), where quantization
is integrated into the training process. This section introduces advanced techniques in PTQ and QAT respectively.
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) primarily includes weight quantization and activation quantization. Weight
quantization aims to quantize model parameters while preserving performance.GPTQ [103] compresses LLMs to 4-bit or
2-bit by quantizing weights layer-by-layer to minimize layer-wise quantization errors.PB-LLM [299], applicable to both
Manuscript submitted to ACM
20 Fali Wang, et al.
PTQ and QAT, retains the most salient weights while binarizing the rest based on magnitudes.BiLLM [147], another
PTQ method, uses a Hessian-based metric to identify salient and non-salient weights. Salient weights undergo binary
residual approximation to minimize loss, while non-salient weights are divided into sparse and concentrated groups for
separate binarization, reducing quantization errors. Activation quantization faces challenges with outliers that can
stretch the quantization range, causing most values to cluster at few bits and introducing significant errors. To address
this, LLM.int8() [80] isolates outlier features for 16-bit processing and handles the rest in 8-bit. SmoothQuant [386]
circumvents per-channel quantization issues by employing a "smoothing" technique that shifts the quantization challenge
from activations to weights through a per-channel scaling transformation. This balance between activating and weight
quantization allows effective 8-bit quantization (W8A8), preserving accuracy while significantly reducing memory and
computational costs. SmoothQuant thus enhances the efficiency of SLMs in resource-constrained environments.
Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) differs from PTQ in that it includes a training phase after the model has been
quantized. When models are quantized to extremes, such as 2-bit or 1-bit, performance typically drops significantly,
but further training can help the model retain its capabilities. For instance, to mitigate performance degradation from
binarization, PB-LLM [299] selectively binarizes only non-salient weights, preserving the most salient ones at higher
precision. This method effectively reduces the model size without significantly impacting performance. Salient weights
are chosen based on their magnitude, ensuring that the most influential weights maintain higher precision to preserve
the model’s reasoning capabilities. The paper explores both post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware
training (QAT) to fine-tune and recover the performance of partially binarized models, achieving a balance between
compression and accuracy. OneBit [400] and BitNet [357] address the severe performance degradation associated
with 1-bit quantization by decomposing floating-point matrices and employing mixed-precision strategies. Specifically,
OneBit introduces Sign-Value-Independent Decomposition (SVID), which decomposes a floating-point matrix into a
1-bit matrix and two floating-point vectors. This method allows LLMs to be quantized to a 1-bit level while minimizing
performance loss. By retaining critical information with the floating-point vectors, OneBit effectively balances extreme
compression with maintaining model accuracy. BitNet b1.58 [231] improves on the original BitNet by introducing a
ternary matrix weight system -1, 0, 1, resulting in a 1.58-bit model. BitNet b1.58 matches the performance of full-precision
models starting from a 3 billion parameter size while further reducing memory and latency costs. LLM-QAT [221]
employs data-free knowledge distillation, where the pre-trained model itself generates data for fine-tuning the quantized
model (student) using logit distillation from the full-precision model (teacher). This method incorporates quantization
of weights, activations, and key-value cache, achieving accurate 4-bit quantization for weights and key-value caches,
and 6-bit for activations, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing post-training quantization methods.
Insights: Insights drawn from quantization strategies include:
•Post-Training Quantization techniques primarily focus on quantizing model weights, where selecting salient
weights is crucial. Beyond weight quantization, handling outliers in activation signals is a significant challenge
in quantizing activations.
•Quantization-Aware Training methods show that low-bit quantization (e.g., 1-bit models) requires additional
tuning to maintain performance. Knowledge can be distilled from the model before quantization to the
quantized model.

3.6 Techniques in LLMs Contributing to SLMs
This subsection explores the potential of advanced techniques such as RAG and MoE, which enhance LLM performance,
to also maintain or boost SLM performance within constrained computational budgets. However, effectively integrating
these techniques into SLMs, which inherently possess limited capabilities, remains an unresolved challenge.
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of language models in knowledge-intensive
tasks by incorporating a retrieval mechanism. This approach allows models to access relevant contextual information
from a data repository in response to user queries. By integrating this retrieved data, RAG-equipped models better
understand specific topics, enabling more informed and accurate outputs. For SLMs, a significant concern is whether
they possess the capacity for long-context reasoning. A recent study [215] compares SLMs at the 7B level with RAG to
larger models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, suggesting that SLMs equipped with RAG can sometimes perform comparably
or even better than LLMs. These findings indicate that RAG for SLMs is effective and represents a promising direction
for future research.
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) [ 39] has emerged as an effective method for substantially scaling up model capacity
with minimal computation overhead in LLMs. The MoE framework is founded on a straightforward yet potent concept:
distinct components of a model, referred to as “experts”, specialize in different tasks or data facets. In this paradigm,
only the relevant experts are activated for a specific input, which manages computational costs while leveraging a
vast pool of specialized knowledge. This scalable and adaptable approach enables increased model capacity without
proportionally escalating computational demands. We argue that MoE is particularly suitable for SLM architectures
[161] as it minimizes both computational load and memory overhead. However, research on MoE for SLMs remains
sparse. Future studies could investigate how large LLM MoE architectures can be effectively compressed into small
ones or how to develop an SLM with MoE tailored for specific devices from scratch.
4 APPLICATIONS OF SMALL LANGUAGE MODELS
4 APPLICATIONS OF SMALL LANGUAGE MODELS
In this section, we delve into the applications of small language models (SLMs) across various NLP tasks and their
deployment strategies. Due to benefits such as enhanced privacy, faster inference, and lower memory requirements,
many NLP applications are now leveraging SLMs over LLMs. Additionally, deploying SLMs often involves considerations
of memory and runtime efficiency, which are crucial for optimizing resource use on budget-constrained edge devices,
particularly mobile phones. Then, we will discuss task-specific applications of SLMs and their deployment methods on
mobile and edge devices.
4.1 Task-specific SLM Applications
This subsection explores the diverse NLP tasks to which SLMs can contribute. Question-answering and coding represent
generative tasks, while recommender systems and web search (though not strictly within the NLP domain) typically
leverage the encoding capabilities of SLMs. Additionally, the application of SLMs on mobile devices is particularly
well-suited due to constraints in memory and computing resources. The representative works are systematically
organized in Table 3.

proprietary LLMs, and difficulties in customization. These issues lead researchers and developers to favor SLMs in
scenarios that demand efficiency, privacy, and customization. Therefore, we explore methods to enhance the capabilities
of SLMs in QA across three key areas: (i) Instruction Tuning of Generic SLMs for QA, (ii) Instruction Tuning of
Domain-Specific SLMs for QA, and (iii) Enhancing SLMs for Out-of-Domain Questions.
Instruction Tuning Generic SLMs for QA. Despite the Phi series’ high question-answering capability, its training
cost with over 3.4T tokens on 512 H100 GPUs for 10 days [ 1] is prohibitive for many researchers and developers.
Instruction tuning [372] offers a cost-effective alternative, enhancing small models by fine-tuning on large model
outputs. Alpaca 7B [329] tunes Llama 7B [338] with 52k ChatGPT-generated examples from 175 seed tasks. This behavior
cloning mimics teacher models effectively but struggles in reasoning-intensive QA tasks where accuracy is key, not style
[60]. To counter it, explanation tuning [238] enhances Llama-2 7B [339] using explanatory LLM answers to improve
reasoning. However, its effectiveness varies with system instructions, and those effective for larger models like GPT-4
may not suit smaller ones. SLMs also struggle to identify optimal system instructions for different tasks. Therefore, Orca
2 [247] addresses this by promoting cautious reasoning, deciding which solution strategy to choose for a given task
among direct answer generation, or “Slow Thinking” strategies (step-by-step, guess and check or explain-then-answer,
etc.) and erasing specific system instructions during training. This involves (1) solution strategy is guided by the
performance of Orca 1 [ 251], (2) writing task-specific system instructions corresponding to the chosen strategy to
obtain teacher responses for each task, and (3) at training time, employing Prompt Erasing to replace student’s system

solutions but also deeper reasoning abilities.
Instruction Tuning Domain SLMs for QA. Beyond instruction tuning for generic SLMs, tuning domain-specific
SLMs is also crucial, as they provide specialized assistance where generic SLMs may underperform. Instruction-tuning
generic SLMs can derive domain SLMs. We summarize some representatives in several domains. (1) In finance, Phogat
et al. [275] transfer financial QA abilities from teacher LLMs such as GPT-4 [2] to specialized SLMs such as Phi-3-Mini [1],
using datasets such as FinQA [56], ConvFinQA [57], and TATQA [454]. They train SLMs with Python programs created
by the teacher model, which detail steps for financial reasoning, including concept comprehension, formula identification,
entity extraction, and calculations. During inference, SLMs generate Python code that an external interpreter executes.
(2) In the medical field, Guo et al . [125] enhance student SLMs, including domain-specific BioGPT (1.6B) [ 230] and
general Llama 7B [338], by fine-tuning on enriched PubMedQA [163] data. This enhancement is achieved by generating
new samples or rewriting existing ones using teacher LLMs, which include the highly knowledgeable GPT-4 and the
relatively weaker ChatGPT. The best SLM, with under 1.6 billion parameters, achieves 75.4% accuracy, surpassing
GPT-4’s 74.4% in few-shot settings on the PubmedQA test sets. It demonstrates that LLMs effectively refine and diversify
question-answer pairs, leading to enhanced performance in a significantly smaller model after fine-tuning. We report
the detailed results of comparisons of instruction-tuned domain-specific language models for QA and larger language
models on FinQA [56] and PubMedQA [163], as shown in Table 4.
Enhancing SLMs for Out-of-Domain Questions. One of the major advantages of LLMs is their strong compre-
hension and logical reasoning abilities, which SLMs often struggle to match due to their limited parameters, especially
when handling unseen or out-of-domain questions. Various methods have been developed to address this limitation,
including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and self-adaptive techniques.
(1) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Incorporating External Knowledge for Domain-Specific QA. RAG ad-
dresses OOD questions by integrating external knowledge during inference, allowing models to access information
beyond their pre-trained parameters. By retrieving relevant documents in real time, RAG enables small language
models to provide accurate answers on specialized topics. In the telecommunications domain, Gichamba et al .
[112] use ColBERT as a dense retrieval system to fetch documents from technical datasets. By encoding queries and
documents separately, ColBERT computes relevance scores, helping small models like Phi-2 and Falcon-7B retrieve
precise technical information to answer complex telecom-related queries. Rationale Ranking [128] addresses
answering unseen questions using smaller language models by integrating external explanatory contexts from
retrieval systems with reasoning rationales from LLMs. This method involves ranking both the retrieved explanatory

24 Fali Wang, et al.
contexts and LLM-generated rationales using a scoring module, which then combines them to form a cohesive
context. Consequently, this integrated approach enhances the SLMs’ performance on unseen questions.
(2) Self-Adaptive Techniques: Enhancing Model Adaptability with Self-Generated Pseudo Labels. Fine-tuning, while
effective in adapting domain knowledge, can be impractical in realistic scenarios where labeled datasets are scarce.
To overcome this, self-adaptive techniques employ self-generated pseudo labels to activate specific aspects of the
target tasks, thereby enhancing model adaptability [312, 347]. Test-time Self-Adaptive Small LMs (T-SAS) [156] first
stochastically generates multiple answers for an unlabeled question. The most plausible answer is then selected via
majority voting to enhance pseudo-label accuracy, serving as a pseudo-label for training during test-time.
Comparison between LLMs and SLMs for QA. When comparing LLMs such as GPT-4 [2] or BLOOM-175B [181]
with fine-tuned SLMs in QA tasks, the benefits of SLMs are clear. LLMs, while versatile across multiple domains due to
extensive pre-training, are computationally demanding, making them less ideal for resource-limited settings. SLMs,
however, when fine-tuned for specific domains, often match or exceed the performance of larger models within those
specialties. The trade-off is between large-scale models’ generalization and small-scale model’s specialization: LLMs
handle diverse domains but may need additional techniques such as knowledge injection for domain-specific queries.
In contrast, domain-specific SLMs, though less flexible, provide higher accuracy and more relevant responses, making
them ideal for edge deployments where computational resources are scarce but domain precision is crucial.
4.1.2 SLM Applications in Coding. The adoption of SLMs for coding offers an alternative to LLMs due to their lower
computational needs and potential for domain-specific tuning. Despite LLMs’ proficiency in code generation and
programming support, SLMs are advantageous for their faster inference, reduced operational costs, and suitability
for real-time environments where rapid responses are crucial. Representative works are discussed next. The Phi
series [1, 155, 200] showcase SLMs’ evolution in coding tasks. For instance, Phi-1 [ 120], a Transformer with 1.3B
parameters, specializes in basic Python coding and achieves notable scores in benchmarks such as HumanEval [120],
which includes 164 programming problems. Subsequent models, Phi-1.5 and Phi-2, have enhanced these capabilities,
while Phi-3 demonstrated SLMs’ potential to rival larger models [1]. The latest model, Phi-3.5-mini, with 3.8B parameters,
excels in long context tasks using advanced fine-tuning and optimization techniques, performing comparably to larger
models such as Llama-3.1-8B-instruct [94] and surpassing smaller ones like Gemma-2 [333].
Another avenue of development is the fine-tuning of general-purpose SLMs for coding tasks [ 23, 121, 227, 292,
331]. For instance, CodeLlama models [292], derivatives of Llama 2 [339], undergo a rigorous fine-tuning process on
domain-specific datasets, enhancing their proficiency in specific programming languages such as Python. They are
trained to handle tasks such as syntax error detection, code suggestion, and infilling, where they learn to predict and
complete missing parts of the code. This specialized fine-tuning improves their ability to interpret and execute detailed
programming instructions, making them highly effective in real-time code editing environments [292]. CodeGemma
models [331], stemming from Google DeepMind’s Gemma framework, also exhibit a focused approach to enhancing
coding capabilities through fine-tuning. These models are specifically engineered for high-performance code generation
and infilling, underpinned by extensive training on a vast corpus of over 500 billion to 1 trillion tokens, predominantly
consisting of code. This comprehensive dataset enables CodeGemma models to excel in mathematical reasoning and
complex problem-solving within code contexts, setting new benchmarks in latency-sensitive applications such as
real-time IDE support and automated code reviews [331].

like Phi-3.5-mini [342] achieve high scores, demonstrating the efficacy of
small models. Mid-sized SLMs (6.7B - 9B Parameters), such as DeepSeek-
Coder 6.7B [ 121] and Llama 3.1 8B [ 94], show improved performance,
indicating that larger model sizes and enhanced training contribute to
better accuracy. Large models (33B and above) like Llama 3.1 405B [ 94],
GPT-4o [263], and Claude 3.5 Sonnet [15] excel, supporting the idea that
bigger models generalize better across diverse coding tasks; ( ii) There’s
a notable trade-off between computational efficiency and performance,
with larger models requiring more resources, impacting their practical
deployment in constrained environments; ( iii) Specialized training and
fine-tuning, as used in models like DeepSeek-Coder [121], are crucial for
excelling in coding tasks, though such models may not handle complex
requests as effectively, highlighting the versatility of general SLMs for
broader applications.
broader applications.
4.1.3 SLM Applications in Recommender Systems. Recommender systems are essential in various online services,
helping to manage information overload and meet users’ personal needs. SLMs enhance recommendation systems by
(1) addressing the cold start problem; (2) reducing popularity bias; (3) improving long-term planning; (4) serving as
personalized recommenders; and (5) acting as content encoders. These applications show the versatility and effectiveness
of SLMs in boosting performance and personalization in recommendation. Next, we introduce the details.
SLM for System Cold Start Problem. Traditional recommendation systems, which utilize historical user-item
interactions such as clicks, purchases, and ratings to learn representations and match items to users, fail in scenarios
lacking any user-item interactions, known as the cold-start recommendation problem, often occurring in start-up
businesses [289]. Although LLMs address this with in-context learning, their slow and costly inference restricts real-time
use. Thus, PromptRec [382] explores using SLMs as in-context recommenders for recommendation system cold-start
problems. However, SLMs often struggle without emergent context-learning abilities. To overcome this, SLMs are
enhanced by pre-training on relevant corpora, using a improved C4 corpus subset [284], and by developing training
prompts for different domains, enhancing cold-start performance. Results show that enhanced SLMs like BERT-mini
[83], with 11.3M parameters, achieve BERT-large’s performance in cold-start scenarios, with only 17% of BERT-large’s
inference time. Similarly, many studies have addressed the cold-start problem by leveraging BERT [133, 261, 441, 459].
For example, ADLRS [133] employs BERT to convert web-crawled item profiles into vectors that highlight key aspects,
aiding recommender systems in acquiring essential initial information.
SLM for Mitigating Popularity Bias. Popularity bias in recommender systems, marked by discrepancies between
item popularity in training datasets and the real world, often stems from using closed-loop datasets with limited
information. Recent LLMs leverage their broad open-world knowledge to better reason about user-item interactions
[206, 214], reducing this bias by providing recommenders with more extensive item details. Using the chain-of-thought
(CoT) prompting, LLMs decompose complex tasks into intermediate reasoning steps, enhancing understanding of
user behavior and interests. However, LLMs’ high resource demands limit their practical use. To overcome this, the

Step-by-step Knowledge Distillation Framework for Recommendation (SLIM) [369] distills LLM reasoning capabilities
into SLMs, keeping just 4% of the original parameters, transitioning from ChatGPT to Llama 7B [ 338]. SLIM uses
detailed LLM templates to extract reasoning steps and streamlined templates for fine-tuning, enabling SLMs to improve
recommender systems by better reasoning on richer item information.
SLM for Long-term Planning. Traditional recommender systems focus on optimizing immediate user responses,
often maximizing short-term gains but overlooking long-term engagement. This can trap users in echo chambers and
filter bubbles [107, 368]. To tackle this, integrating planning capabilities into recommendations to balance immediate
and long-term outcomes is vital. LMs, with their extensive knowledge and reasoning abilities, are expected to enhance
planning capabilities. BiLLP [309] adopts a hierarchical learning approach with macro and micro-learning phases. In
macro-learning, a Planner and a Reflector, both as SLM instances like Llama-2-7B [339], operate; the Planner forms
long-term plans using high-level experiences, while the Reflector updates plans based on past actions. Micro-learning
uses an SLM-based Actor-Critic mechanism for personalized planning, with the Actor implementing plans and the
Critic assessing actions for long-term benefits. The use of SLMs for long-term planning, similar to their use in cold-start
scenarios, remains underexplored and merits further research.

SLMs as a Personalized Recommender. Generative language
model-based recommender systems require integrating user knowl-
edge, typically achieved through fine-tuning. Fine-tuning techniques
like LoRA [142] can incorporate extensive knowledge across all users
by training an external module with a small number of parameters A
and B, but this approach often overlooks individual user preferences.
To address this, RecLoRA [455] utilizes Vicuna-7B [61] to integrate
personalized knowledge into SLMs/LLMs tailored for recommenda-
tion tasks, as illustrated in Figure 14. Specifically, RecLoRA maintains
a set of parallel, independent LoRA weights (A𝑖,B𝑖), allowing for
the customization of language model parameters to match individual
user preferences more effectively.
SLM as a Content Encoder. Language models, particularly when deep, provide an effective starting point for fine-
tuning on downstream tasks. In news recommendation systems, the representational capability of a model significantly
impacts performance. Consequently, many news recommender systems now employ language models fine-tuned on
specific datasets as text encoders. For example, Wu et al . [379] conducts pioneering work using a pre-trained language
model to enhance large-scale news recommender systems by substituting traditional news encoders with a BERT
model [83]. However, BERT may struggle to capture content as it is pre-trained on limited data. Therefore,ONCE [214]
propose using Llama-2-7B [339] as an encoder to overcome the limitations of BERT in content-based recommendations.
Additionally, the study explores the synergistic use of LLMs in recommendation systems, finding that SLMs optimized
with LoRA [142] outperform the recommendation results of systems assisted by generic LLMs such as ChatGPT.
4.1.4 SLM Applications in Web Search. Web search systems, involving retrieval and ranking, face challenges due to
the diverse web documents and search queries. Traditional keyword-matching methods often fall short because of
phrasing variations and the long-tail distribution of queries and content, complicating accurate semantic inference.
Effective integration of retrieval and ranking models is also crucial. Language models, serving as content encoders, help
overcome semantic challenges through their language understanding from pre-training [63, 89, 359]. Joint training of

retrieval and ranking models addresses integration, with SLMs ranking retrieved documents and acting as re-rankers.
Additionally, SLMs serve as rewriters in scenarios requiring enhanced query understanding. Thus, in web search, SLMs
fulfill three roles: (1) content encoder , (2) ranker, and (3) rewriter, as depicted in Figure 15. Next, we give details.
SLM as a Content Encoder. Text embeddings are vector representations that encode semantic information, widely
used in retrieval; SLM-based dense retrieval utilizes pre-trained deep language understanding to effectively tackle
semantic challenges. H-ERNIE [63] employs a hierarchical model that encodes queries and documents at multiple
granularity—character, word, and phrase—to improve specificity and relevance in web search results by aggregating
finer details into coarser layers, addressing issues like ambiguous queries.Implicit Interaction ( 𝐼3) [89] uses BERT [83]
as a content encoder, generating implicit pseudo-queries from passages to enable high online efficiency with offline
caching of passage vectors. However, ERNIE and BERT-style models overlook advancements in SLMs such as context
length extension [292]. Thus, Peng et al . [272] employs LLaMa-7B [338] and Vicuna-7B [61] as semantic encoders for
embedding retrieval, demonstrating improved performance through soft prompt tuning. CoCondenser [109] addresses
sensitivity to noisy data and large batch requirements during dense retriever training. Using the Condenser architecture
with Transformer blocks, the model condenses information into dense vectors effectively.
SLM as a Ranker. The reranking task improves the order of multiple candidates to enhance retrieval quality because
rerankers are more accurate than embedding retrievers. InPars (Inquisitive Parrots for Search) [36] employs the T5
base 220M [284] as a re-ranker to enhance the BM25 retriever [291]. Initially, BM25 selects 1K candidates, re-ranked
by a fine-tuned T5 model (monoT5) adapted as a binary classifier to assess document-query relevance. Training data,
generated by GPT-3 [37], formulates queries and selects random negative examples. Experiments show the monoT5-
enhanced retriever significantly outperforms GPT-3; for example, it achieves a 0.3599 MAP score on the TREC-DL 2020
dataset [69], surpassing GPT-3’s 0.3163.
SLM as a Rewriter. Queries to the retriever, typically just a few keywords, may reveal a knowledge gap between
the query and the knowledge needed for effective retrieval, thus limiting performance. To address this, the “rewrite-
retrieve-read” framework [233] uses T5-large [284] to bridge the knowledge gap in queries by rewriting them for
more effective retrieval. This rewriter, trained via reinforcement learning with downstream LLM performance as a
reward, outperforms general LLM rewrites. For example, it achieves a 45.97 F1 score on HotpotQA, surpassing the
generic LLM’s 43.85 F1 score.

4.1.5 SLM Applications in Mobile-device. The use of cloud-based LLMs on devices raises privacy concerns and their
large size limits real-time responses in urgent scenarios such as medical emergencies. To overcome these issues,
researchers are creating smaller, domain-specific models (SLMs) that offer accurate results and suit mobile use. This
subsection discusses SLM applications on mobile devices, focusing on three aspects: (1) software API calls, (2) mobile
control, and (3) basic NLP applications.
SLM for Tool Learning. Integrating LLMs with APIs enhances capabilities but incurs high training costs, prompting
a shift to smaller, task-specific models that cut costs but risk errors. In response,Octopus [52] uses a diverse dataset from
over 30K APIs and curriculum learning [217] to improve API function accuracy. This method boosts API performance
in models like Codellama-7b [ 292] and Google’s Gemma series [ 332]. PhoneLM-1.5B-Call [417] is fine-tuned on
DroidCall [389] datasets and achieves comparable performance compared to GPT-4o-mini [262]. 𝛼-UMI [307] employs
SLMs as planners, callers, and summarizers within multi-agent systems, outperforming a single LLM in tool uses.

text, automating tasks and enhancing user hands-

SLM for Basic NLP Applications on Devices Per-
forming basic NLP tasks such as text rewriting directly on
the device can enable personalization while ensuring pri-
vacy. The sparse annotation on devices is a challenge.Qin
et al . [278] utilizes self-supervised data selection and
synthesis for on-device fine-tuning, leveraging sparse an-
notations and limited storage effectively. This approach,
demonstrated in Figure 18, employs the Llama-3B model
[338] and the LoRA fine-tuning method [142], enhancing
personalization by efficiently managing data through met-
rics including embedding entropy and domain-specific
scores. In mobile text rewriting, Zhu et al . [458] train
the compact Palm 2-XXS model [ 14] using data gener-
ated by the larger Palm 2-L to ensure user privacy and
accommodate device constraints. On its new benchmark,
MESSAGEREWRITEEVAL, Palm 2-XXS achieves a BLEU
score of 34.59, outperforming LLaMa-7B (16.65) [ 338].
Tests on the Samsung S23 show lower latency (29 tokens/s) than a 4-bit LLaMa-7B on a MacBook M1 Pro (18-22
tokens/s), proving its mobile efficiency for text rewriting.
Insights: We draw several key insights from the development of task-specific SLMs:
•There is considerable potential in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of small models by integrating self-adaptive
techniques with further fine-tuning and optimization of RAG-based methods.
•The growing relevance of SLMs in coding highlights their cost-effectiveness and efficiency as alternatives to LLMs,
providing quick processing and easy fine-tuning for specialized tasks; while LLMs handle complex tasks well, SLMs,
optimized and fine-tuned on specific data, are increasingly essential in resource-limited settings.
•SLMs significantly enhance recommendation systems due to their robust generalization, reasoning abilities, and in-context
learning, addressing key challenges such as cold-start problems and distribution biases. They support long-term planning,
replace traditional encoders, and use parallel low-rank parameters to inject personalized user knowledge effectively.
•SLMs play a crucial role in web search such as document encoding, text reordering, and query rewriting, often outper-
forming LLMs through techniques such as supervised fine-tuning, soft prompt tuning, unsupervised contrastive loss, and
reinforcement learning, thereby enhancing adaptability and efficiency.
•SLMs are utilized on mobile devices primarily for privacy and memory constraints, with applications in API calls and
mobile control; they are typically developed by generating data with LLMs and fine-tuning with SLMs, or by using local
SLMs to handle privacy with LLMs boosting performance, and their training involves innovative techniques like learning
from data streams and managing non-IID time series data.

4.2 SLM Deployment on Mobile and Edge Devices
On-device applications benefit uniquely from the memory-saving efficiency and rapid runtime performance of SLMs,
which offer advantages over LLMs. However, devices with extremely limited resources may still struggle with the
parameter sizes of SLMs. To ensure both memory and runtime remain within acceptable range while still maintaining
performance, it is crucial to integrate technologies that facilitate the deployment of SLMs on resource-constrained
devices. The primary challenge for memory-efficient technologies arises from the inherent size of the SLMs and their
associated caches. To address this, we survey existing works focused on compressing SLMs and their caches. Additionally,
the large size of models significantly impacts runtime efficiency due to the extensive computing workload and potential
weight transfers between the memory buffer and RAM/GPU memory. Other challenges include switching the Mixture
of Experts between CPU and GPU memory and managing resource scheduling when deploying SLMs across multiple
local devices. Therefore, in this subsection, we review representative works that address these challenges under two
aspects: memory efficiency optimization and runtime efficiency optimization , as systematically compiled in Table 6.
4.2.1 Memory Efficiency Optimization. Memory efficiency involves minimizing the memory usage of both the model
and the KV cache during deployment. This is typically achieved through model compression techniques such as
quantization [207, 285, 422, 448], the cache of MoE experts [416], and KV cache compression [165].
Compression on model parameters. Quantization, a common method for deploying SLMs, lowers numerical
precision to significantly save memory while preserving accuracy. We detail quantization strategies in Sections 2.3.3
and 3.5, focusing here on representative works for edge devices. EDGE-LLM [422] adapts LLMs for edge devices using
a Layer-wise Unified Compression (LUC) method that combines layer-specific pruning and quantization to reduce
computational demands and an Adaptive Layer Tuning and Voting scheme to optimize memory use while ensuring
performance. Meanwhile, LLM-PQ [448] addresses quantization and model layer partitioning for heterogeneous
clusters, incorporating a Cost Model and an Indicator Generator to optimize bit-width assignment and layer partitioning
through integer linear programming, enhancing quantization for complex computational setups. Activation-aware
Weight Quantization (AWQ) [207] is a hardware-friendly, low-bit, weight-only quantization method for on-device
LLMs, preserving essential weights based on activation distribution to minimize quantization loss. MoE-I2 [404] prune
less important experts and applies low-rank decomposition to the remaining experts to further optimize efficiency.

Cache of MoE Experts. Beyond standard quantization, which reduces storage for all model parameters, another
strategy involves caching a mixture of experts (MoE). Driven by the fact that memory storage is more cost-effective and
scalable than computing capacity, the MoE architecture [154] boosts performance while minimizing computational
costs by activating only portions of the LLM as needed. However, this approach incurs significant memory overhead,
making it impractical for edge device memory constraints. For example, Switch Transformers [100], with 32 experts per
layer, require 54GBs of memory for inference, exceeding the capacity of most edge devices. Yi et al. [416] notes that in
the Switch Transformers model, although most of the model weights (86.5%) are attributed to experts, these weights
account for only a small fraction (26.4%) of the computations. To address this,EdgeMoE [416] introduces a method
where experts are loaded into an expert memory buffer only when activated, achieving approximately 3×memory
savings compared to the baseline where all weights are held in memory.
KV Cache Compression . When serving LMs for inference, using a KV cache is common practice to avoid intensive
recalculations and speed up generation [276]. However, cache memory consumption escalates with model size and
sequence length, posing a challenge for edge devices. To manage this, offloading techniques transfer KV caches to
CPU memory [12, 308], although this can introduce significant overhead due to the switching costs between GPUs
and CPUs. Token dropping compresses cache size by keeping only key tokens, often identified by low attention scores
[111, 220, 444]. However, this method struggles with complex tasks, especially at high compression levels, due to
increased estimation errors in compressed KV values. GEAR [165] addresses these issues by enhancing KV cache
quantization with error-reduction techniques, including: (i) quantizing caches of similar magnitudes to ultra-low
precision, (ii) using a low-rank matrix for efficient quantization residual approximation, and (iii) employing a sparse
matrix for correcting outliers. This approach separates coherent from incoherent approximation errors, enabling
near-lossless KV cache compression and achieving up to 2.29×peak memory reduction.
Besides, Dynamic Memory Compression (DMC) [256] adaptively compresses the KV cache by either adding
new key and value representations directly or blending them with the top cache item using a weighted average.
Transformer-Lite [193] tackles the redundancy of storing the KV cache twice in model inputs and outputs, which
increases memory use. It optimizes storage by allocating a large tensor based on the maximum sequence length needed
for inference. Sub-tensors are then created from this main tensor at different address offsets to serve as input and output
KV caches, allowing direct writing to the correct locations during inference and removing extra copying steps.LLMaaS
[419] introduces LLM as a Service for mobile devices, managing all apps through LLMS. This system uses chunk-wise
KV cache compression and swapping, enabling efficient context switching within memory constraints. By segmenting
the KV cache into independently compressed and swapped chunks, LLMS balances memory use and I/O bandwidth
better than token-level or context-level management.
4.2.2 Runtime Efficiency Optimization. The goal of decreasing computing workload aligns with enhancing memory
efficiency through methods such as quantization, as mentioned in the previous section. Decreasing model weight
precision or reducing the number of weights naturally lowers latency. Other runtime efficiency techniques of minimizing
inference latency involve, reducing prefill latency, early exits, large and small model collaboration, decreasing switching
time in MoE, and reducing latency in distributed SLMs.
Reducing prefill latency. mllm-NPU [395] is the first LLM inference system that leverages on-device NPU (neural
processing units) to reduce prefill latency and energy consumption. It incorporates a chunk-sharing graph, shadow
outlier execution, and out-of-order subgraph execution to enhance NPU offloading efficiency. Experiments have shown
mllm-NPU’s superior performance benefits, including up to 43.6× speedup and 59.5× energy savings.

Dynamic Early Exits A decoupled runtime saving technique is dynamic early exits. Originating from BranchyNet
[335], which introduces exit branches after specific convolution layers in the CNN model, this concept has been adapted
for PLMs as Transformer layer-wise early exiting [391]. Early exiting enables dynamic acceleration during inference
and reduces temporal overhead by allowing exit without passing through all model layers. To address the inconsistency
issue arising from exiting at different layers, COST-EFF [305] distills a multi-exit model from the original PLM.
Large and Small Model Collaboration Model collaboration, deploying SLMs on devices with cloud-based LLM
support, enhances runtime efficiency. LLMs will increase latency when directly deployed via mobile engines like
llama.cpp due to a large number of computing operations. LLMCad [394] addresses this by using a real-time, memory-
resident SLM for simple tokens such as determiners and punctuation. The SLM generates tokens, while a cloud-based
LLM verifies and corrects them, speeding up the process. LLMCad enhances token generation up to 9.3×by pairing the
memory-resident SLM, Llama 2 7B, with the cloud-based LLM, Llama 2 13B, cutting latency from 16.2 to 3.9 seconds on
Xiaomi Pro for TruthfulQA tasks [208].
Reducing MoE Switching Time. To reduce latency in MoE architectures caused by frequently switching experts in
limited device memory, EdgeMoE [416] enhances runtime efficiency by preemptively predicting which expert will be
needed, based on the observed long-tail distribution of unbalanced expert activations. It utilizes a statistical model, built
offline, to estimate expert activation probabilities in transformer layers from previous activations. During inference,
EdgeMoE preemptively loads the most likely needed expert, accelerating inference by 1.11×to 2.78×and significantly
reducing latency. For instance, in a switch transformer model with 8 experts, latency drops from approximately 0.7s to
0.3s, outperforming the baseline method that preloads experts based on hit ratios.
Reducing Latency in Distributed SLMs. Distributing an SLM across smaller devices reduces the need for extensive
model compression while preserving accuracy. However, this approach faces challenges that incur latency such as
managing diverse device capabilities, handling data dependencies between model segments, and adapting to dynamic
resource availability. To address these issues,LinguaLinked [447] addresses these issues by optimizing model assign-
ment to match device capabilities and minimize data transmission, implementing runtime load balancing to redistribute
tasks and prevent bottlenecks, and enhancing communication for efficient data exchange between segments. With
multi-threading, the system improves, achieving acceleration rates between 1.73×and 2.65×for both quantized and
full-precision models.
Insights: We draw several key insights from the deployment of SLMs:
• Model size remains a bottleneck for both memory and runtime efficiency. A common solution is model quantization, which reduces model
precision to save memory and lessen computing workload, thereby boosting inference speed [207, 223, 253, 285, 422, 448]. Similarly, KV
cache compression also helps achieve these efficiency gains [165, 193, 256, 419].
• Mixture of Experts (MoE) is commonly used in SLMs to enhance performance using the same computing resources, but it results in increased
memory usage. To address this, only activated experts are loaded into the memory buffer while the majority are stored cold on disk. However,
the cost of switching can slow down inference. Designing a preemptive expert pre-load strategy could therefore accelerate the inference
[416].
[416].
• Model collaboration between local SLMs and cloud-based LLMs enhances both memory and runtime efficiency by using smaller models on
local devices, which are then verified by cloud LLMs to ensure performance is maintained. Using SLMs locally reduces memory usage and
shortens the inference time from the local model. However, internet latency and delays in cloud LLM inference can still introduce latency.
Verifying SLM outputs every 𝑁 tokens using LLMs can effectively mitigate this latency [394].
• One deployment approach involves deploying SLMs/LLMs across multiple trusted local devices to maintain original performance while only
loading a fraction of the model weights. However, this method can incur latency due to varying device capabilities and resource scheduling
challenges. To address these issues, optimizing model assignment to align with device capabilities and minimizing data transmission are
effective strategies [447].

5 GENERIC AND DOMAIN-SPECIFIC SMALL LANGUAGE MODELS
This section investigates small language models (with fewer than 7 billion parameters) in both general and specific
domains. It details the methods of obtaining these small language models, the datasets, and the evaluation tasks,
exploring the techniques for acquiring SLMs through compression, fine-tuning, or training from scratch. Additionally,
we summarize the representative small language models, as detailed in Table 7 and 10.
5.1 Generic-domain SLMs
Overview. SLMs, with fewer parameters than LLMs, enhance computational efficiency in pre-training, fine-tuning,
and inference, reducing memory and energy demands—crucial for resource-limited environments. Their compact,
localized nature boosts privacy, personalization, and response times, making them ideal for low-power edge devices.
Therefore, SLMs are attracting increasing attention, and various models are being developed. Table 7 summarizes
current representative generic-domain 42 SLMs/SLM families. Although all chosen SLMs have similar architectures,
they vary in specific training datasets and techniques, with some datasets not being openly available. Taking the latest
Llama 3.2 1B models [7] in Figure 19 as an example, its parameter size and use of filtered high-quality training data,
pruning-based initialization, knowledge distillation pre-training tasks, and training techniques such as Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT), Rejection Sampling (RS), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) distinguish it from others.

5.1.1 Architecture Design. From Table 7, we observe several trends in component choices for SLMs:
(1) Recent SLMs frequently employ Grouped Query Attention (GQA) in self-attention mechanisms because it can
reduce computational complexity. GQA achieves this by sharing query representations across multiple heads while
keeping key and value representations separate. This approach aligns with the goals of SLM to enhance efficiency
without compromising functionality.

(2) The choice of activation function should balance model capability and efficiency. ReLU, known for its efficiency,
introduces greater sparsity to the model, which facilitates faster coefficient calculations for inference acceleration. In
contrast, SwiGLU’s parameters are learned during training, allowing the model to dynamically adapt to diverse tasks
and datasets, thereby enhancing model capabilities and establishing it as a state-of-the-art option. SiLU, situated
between these two, is favored for its balance of computational efficiency and model performance.
(3) RMS normalization is commonly used than layer normalization due to its reduced computational demands.
A basic introduction to these options is provided in Section 2. Apart from component choices, there are notable
innovations in architecture for SLMs:
•Mobilellm [223] highlights that deeper models are more effective than wider ones for improving performance.
•Embedding sharing [440] is crucial as embedding layers often constitute over 20% of a model’s parameters—for
example, with 512 dimensions and a 32k vocabulary, each layer holds 16M parameters in a 125M-parameter model.
Smaller models often reuse these weights for both input and output layers, enhancing efficiency and compactness.
•Layer sharing [223] increases hidden layers in small Transformer models without additional storage costs.
•Shared FFNs [336] make up about 65% of all trainable parameters, with attention mechanisms and heads accounting
for the rest. Sharing FFN parameters across all transformer layers of an SLM is proposed to increase efficiency.
•Architecture search ahead of pre-training. PhoneLM [ 417] proposes a principle for constructing on-device small
language models: searching for a resource-efficient architecture on a given hardware to optimize the speed-capacity
trade-off before pretraining. This approach inspires the tailored selection of architectural components for on-device
SLMs, based on specific compositional requirements such as computing efficiency, model capability, and safety.
A detailed description of these architectural designs can be found in Section 3.1.
5.1.2 Training Datasets. From Table 7, we can observe a set of widely used training datasets in SLM development. We
provide the details below:
provide the details below:
•Pile [108]: It comprises 22 smaller, high-quality diverse corpora from various domains, such as Pile-CC, PubMed
Central, ArXiv, GitHub, and FreeLaw, designed to offer a comprehensive foundation for language model training.
The dataset contains 207 billion tokens and totals 825 GB.
•C4 (Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus) [284]: This dataset includes 350 billion tokens, representing a cleaned version
of the Common Crawl web corpus, intended to capture a wide snapshot of the internet 4.
•The Stack [174]: It contains 6 trillion tokens of source code from over 300 programming languages, useful for
developing code-centric AI applications. Python-edu in smollm-corpus [27] consists of Python files that are scored

high-quality annotations for educational value.
From the analysis of these datasets, we can derive several critical insights regarding the development of SLMs: (i) Data
quality is crucial for training effective SLMs, involving sophisticated filtering like removing duplicates or irrelevant
content, often with another LLM’s help. For example, the TinyStories corpus [96] is tailored for simplicity, ideal for
training models to handle straightforward narratives. RedPajama-V2 [ 67] uses the CCNet pipeline to process 30B
documents, providing quality signals and IDs for creating a 20B deduplicated dataset. (ii) Code Data: Source code
constitutes a significant component of valuable data for training models, particularly because of its structured nature and
logical content. Training on code data enhances a model’s reasoning capabilities and supports its ability to generalize
across multiple natural languages, which is crucial for applications requiring robust problem-solving and interpretation
skills in diverse coding environments [17, 104, 120, 236]
5.1.3 Training Algorithms. To enhance the alignment of SLMs with desirable properties such as safety and reasoning,
training algorithms, particularly during the fine-tuning phase, are crucial in evolving pre-trained SLMs.
•Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [283] presents a simpler alternative to RLHF for optimizing language
models based on human preferences, preventing explicit reward modeling and reinforcement learning. Instead, DPO
modifies log probabilities of responses with a dynamic weighting mechanism to prevent model degradation common
in probability ratio-focused methods. The DPO loss function is:
L𝐷𝑃𝑂(𝜋𝜃; 𝜋ref)= −E(𝑥,𝑦𝑤,𝑦𝑙 )∼𝐷

log 𝜎

𝛽log 𝜋𝜃(𝑦𝑤|𝑥)
𝜋ref(𝑦𝑤|𝑥)−𝛽log 𝜋𝜃(𝑦𝑙|𝑥)
𝜋ref(𝑦𝑙|𝑥)

where 𝜋𝜃 is the policy being optimized, 𝜋ref is the reference policy, 𝐷 includes tuples (𝑥,𝑦𝑤,𝑦𝑙), 𝜎 is the sigmoid
function, and 𝛽 scales the log-ratios between 𝜋𝜃 and 𝜋ref, guiding the model towards human-preferred outputs.
•Reinforcement Learning from Contrast Distillation (RLCD) [405] aims to calibrate generative SLMs/LLMs
towards embodying harmless and beneficial characteristics. The process starts with an unaligned LM and initial
prompts, which are modified into two variants 𝑝+and 𝑝−, intended to promote and suppress, respectively, attributes
like helpfulness and harmlessness. Upon inputting these prompts, the LM generates outputs 𝑜+and 𝑜−, with 𝑜+
automatically designated as the preferred response. This automation speeds up training by avoiding additional
evaluative scoring. The training continues under the RLHF framework.
•Conditioned Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (C-RLFT) , by OpenChat [356], enhances model performance
by incorporating low-quality data during SFT. C-RLFT leverages varied data qualities with simple rewards (e.g., expert
data at 1 credit, sub-optimal at 0.1), using distinct prompt tokens to condition data sources, eliminating costly human
feedback. Similarly, Data Mix [274] trains on English text in three stages, reducing noisy web data progressively in
each stage in favor of higher-quality data.
•Explanation Tuning, proposed by Orca [251], addresses the limitations of standard instruction-based fine-tuning,
which often restricts SLMs to style imitation rather than reasoning. It uses system prompts with instructions to
direct GPT-4 to produce detailed explanations or perform step-by-step reasoning. The resulting instructions and the
responses are used as a dataset for fine-tuning SLMs to have better ability of reasoning.

•Progressive Learning, proposed by Orca [251], aims to bridge the capability gap between Orca and the more capable
GPT-4. It starts with training on five million data points from ChatGPT, followed by one million from GPT-4. Research
suggests that an intermediate-level teacher can improve distillation effects, enabling a stepwise learning approach
where students start with simpler examples and gradually move to more complex ones, receiving improved reasoning
and explanations from a more advanced teacher.
•Prompt Erasing introduced by Orac 2 [247], is a distillation strategy designed to enhance the independent reasoning
capabilities of student SLMs. In this approach, a more capable teacher LLM is given intricate prompts intended to
elicit specific strategic behaviors and more precise outcomes. During the training phase, the SLM is exposed only to
the task instruction and the resulting behavior, without access to the original intricate prompts that initiate such
responses. This technique, known as Prompt Erasing, positions the student model as a cautious reasoner because it
not only learns to perform specific reasoning steps but also develops strategies for approaching tasks at a higher level.
•Maximal Update Parameterization ( 𝜇P) optimizes control initialization, layer-wise learning rates, and activation
magnitudes to ensure stable training regardless of model layer widths. This method enhances training stability and
allows the same optimizer settings, especially learning rates, to be used across different model scales. For instance,
Cerebras-GPT [314] employs 𝜇P to train its models efficiently.
5.1.4 Model Performance. To compare the performance of SLMs, we have extracted experimental results from two
recent and concurrent studies published in June 2024, OLMo [116] and MobiLlama [336], and the recently proposed
edge-device Llama 3.2 1B & 3B in September 2024 5. The extracted results are merged and shown in Table 8. From the
table, we can find that the following evaluation benchmarks are commonly used:
(1) MMLU [134]: Evaluate broad knowledge across diverse fields such as humanities, science, technology, engineering,
and management. It includes multiple-choice questions covering 57 tasks ranging from elementary mathematics to
US history, computer science, law, and beyond, with a total of 14K test samples.
(2) HellaSwag [429]: Assesses the model’s ability to select the correct ending to scenarios from multiple options,
testing common sense reasoning, including 10K test samples.
(3) ARC [65]: The AI2’s Reasoning Challenge (ARC) dataset features multiple-choice science exam questions for
grades 3 to 9, divided into Easy and Challenge partitions, with the latter containing more complex questions
necessitating reasoning. Most questions offer four answer choices. ARC includes a supporting knowledge base of
14.3M unstructured text passages, with 1.17K test samples in ARC_Challenge and 2.25K in ARC_Easy.
(4) PIQA [32]: A commonsense reasoning dataset designed to evaluate the physical knowledge of NLP models. It
presents questions (goals) that require physical commonsense for correct resolution, alongside two detailed response
options (sol1 and sol2). The dataset comprises 3,000 test samples.
(5) Winogrande [294]: a dataset structured as a fill-in-the-blank task with binary options, designed to assess common-
sense reasoning. The dataset includes 1,767 test samples by default splits.
Accuracy is used as the evaluation metric in the table. Open Language Model (OLMo) [116] is publicly available with
its training data and code 6. MobiLlama [336] is a general-purpose SLM designed from scratch, available in 0.5B and
0.8B versions. It adopts a unique approach by using a shared FFN across all transformer blocks, enhancing efficiency.
MobiLlama also show high efficiency on diverse hardware (Table 9).

From Table 8 and 9, we can conclude that: (1) MobiLlama 0.5B and 0.8B demonstrate that a shared FFN design can
facilitate excellent performance in SLMs with fewer than 1B parameters, even rivaling some models in the 1B-3B range.
(2) The performance of MobiLlama 1.2B and OLMo 1.2B illustrates that advanced SLM architectures incorporating
high-quality data, SwiGLU, non-parametric layer normalization, RoPE, BPE tokenization, and a shared FFN design
can achieve competitive results among models with 1B-3B parameters. (3) MobiLlama demonstrates that SLMs can
significantly reduce resource consumption on low-end hardware devices, achieving comparable performance while
using a smaller proportion of battery power, memory, and GPU utilization. (4) Popular techniques such as pruning,
quantization, distillation, SFT, and DPO, utilized in Llama 3.2, have substantially enhanced SLM performance.
Insights: We draw several key insights from the development of generic-domain SLMs:
•Typical SLM architectures generally incorporate features such as GQA, gated FFN with SiLU activations, RMS normalization,
deep and thin architectures, embedding sharing, layer sharing, and shared FFNs.
•Although these components are widely used, current research has not yet thoroughly explored their specific contributions
within SLMs.
within SLMs.
•The importance of data quality in SLM research is increasingly emphasized, often considered more critical than the
quantity of data and model architectural configurations.
•Post-pretraining, meticulous fine-tuning is often required to enhance the safety of SLMs, involving strategies to distill
capabilities from LLMs better. Common strategies include explanatory tuning, progressive learning, and prompt erasing.
5.2 Domain-Specific SLMs
5.2 Domain-Specific SLMs
Overview. The capability of LLMs to generate human-like text has significantly captured public interest, highlighting
their potential in the field of general artificial intelligence. However, inefficiencies persist when integrating LLMs into
specialized applications due to resource constraints. Unlike the need for extensive general knowledge and capabilities,
domain-specific SLMs should focus on well-defined tasks and expertise pertinent to specific fields. For instance,
specialized models can significantly impact biomedical research and healthcare by fine-tuning for interpretable mental
health analysis, or assisting humans in legal dialogues and financial tasks through instruction tuning, showcasing their
potential transformative influence. Given the limited number of SLMs specialized in specific domains, we demonstrate
some existing SLMs individually across healthcare, science, finance, and law domains.
5.2.1 SLMs for Healthcare. Hippocrates [3] is an open-source medical language model framework with free access to
its data, codebase, checkpoints, and protocols 7. It utilizes a medical pre-training corpus from Medical Guidelines, PMC-
Patients [452], and PubMedQA-contexts [163], totaling about 300M tokens. The Hippo series, a 7B model, undergoes
continuous pre-training, instruction tuning, and RLHF. Fine-tuned on Mistral and Llama-2, it rivals 70B models in
some evaluation. For example, Hippo-Mistral 7B scores 59.9% on MedQA, outperforming Meditron 70B [55] at 58.5%.
BioMedLM [34], a 2.7B GPT-style model trained on PubMed content [108], excels in biomedical QA after fine-tuning,
achieving 57.3% on MedMCQA (dev) and 69.0% on MMLU medical genetics exams. Available on Hugging Face Hub8.
AdaLM [414] enhances domain-specific SLMs by continuing training on a medical-focused SLM atop a general pre-
trained model. It emperically validates adaptation then distillation is the most effective distillation way. AdaLM modified

5.2.2 SLMs for Science. SciGLM [435] is a collegiate-level scientific language model overcoming data scarcity with
a self-reflective instruction annotation framework. Utilizing GPT-4 [2], it generates detailed reasoning for unlabeled
scientific problems through three steps with designed prompts in Table ??: (i) CoT prompt for step-by-step answers
(Prompt 1), (ii) reflective prompt for correcting errors (Prompt 2), and (iii) integrating the correct answer for clarity
(Prompt 3). The SciInstruct dataset spans physics, chemistry, math, and proofs, tuning ChatGLM-6B’s [93] reasoning
abilities. SciGLM boosts the base model’s (ChatGLM3-6B-Base) scientific QA accuracy by 3.06% on benchmarks such as
CEval-Hard [149], CEval-Sci [149], MMLU-Sci [134], SciEval [319], and SciBench [363]. Llemma [22], an SLM derived
from CodeLlama [292], specializes in mathematical reasoning. By continual pre-training, its 7B model is evolved on

MATH [134], GSM8k [66], OCWCourses [186], MMLU-STEM [134], and SAT, surpassing all comparable open-weight
models. ChemLLM [436] is a chemistry-focused language model that utilizes its proposed ChemData, a dataset
designed for instruction tuning that transforms chemical data into dialogue format for training. ChemLLM is based
on InternLM2-Base-7B [40], initially enhancing its language skills with a multi-corpus of 1.7 million Q&A pairs from
Hugging Face, then fine-tunes using ChemData and the multi-corpus to maintain its general capabilities. ChemLLM
excels in interdisciplinary chemical tasks within the proposed ChemBench, achieving results comparable to GPT-4 [2]
and outperforming GPT-3.5 with a score of 92.6 in Mol2caption, slightly below that of GPT-4. AstroLLaMA [258]
introduces an astronomy-focused language model. Based on Llama-2-7B [339] and enhanced via continual pre-training,
it has been developed using over 300K astronomy abstracts from arXiv 11. AstroLLaMA achieves 30% lower perplexity
than Llama-2-7B, indicating substantial improvements in domain adaptability. AstroLLaMA is available12 for tasks
such as automated paper summarization and conversational agent development in astronomy.
5.2.3 SLMs for Finance and Law. MindLLM [412] introduces a bilingual (Chinese and English) SLM, pretrained on
the Pile dataset [108] for English and WuDao [424], CBook, and various Chinese web content for Chinese. Bilingual
training enhances capacity and prevents catastrophic forgetting. It explores specific domains such as law and finance
through supervised fine-tuning. In law, it utilizes publicly available legal data, scenario-based Q&A from LaW-GPT
[139], and NLP-based legal tasks from DISC-LawLLM [427]. In finance, EastMoney 13 is selected as the data source.
Insights: We draw several key insights from the development of domain-specific SLMs:
•Adapting SLMs to domain-specific data is a common practice for acquiring domain-specific SLMs, prompting many to
create their datasets [258, 406, 435, 436]. These datasets are often annotated using LLMs like GPT-4 and used to continual
pre-train or fine-tune general models such as LLaMa-2-7B [ 3, 34]. To ensure the data quality, specialized annotation
frameworks are developed, such as SciGLM [435].
frameworks are developed, such as SciGLM [435].
•In domains with abundant corpora, training a general model from scratch and fine-tuning it using SFT [412] is practical.
Bilingual settings during training can prevent catastrophic forgetting.
•Distilling general capabilities from LLMs while integrating domain-specific knowledge from corpora is another method
for developing domain-specific SLMs [414].

6 SLMS FOR LLMS
In this section, we provide a comprehensive review of how SLMs enhance LLMs. While LLMs are robust, they face
challenges such as latency during inference, labor-intensive fine-tuning, noise filtration issues in retrieval, suboptimal
zero-shot performance, copyright infringement risks, and evaluation difficulties. SLMs can help LLMs to alleviate these
issues. Research in this field can be categorized into five primary areas: (i) using SLMs for reliable LLM generation; (ii)
extracting prompts for LLMs using SLMs; (iii) fine-tuning LLMs with SLMs; (iv) applying SLMs in LLM applications; (v)
utilizing SLMs as guardian; and (vi) evaluating LLMs using SLMs. A summary of representative work in each category
along with their key point is given in Table 12. Next, we introduce each category in detail.

6.1 SLM for Reliable LLM Generation
Although LLMs generally produce fluent and convincing text, they can occasionally generate erroneous responses
[159, 349]. Additionally, LLMs are susceptible to privacy breaches from untrusted data collection, which can erode user
trust or cause harm. To address these issues, recent studies have focused on using SLMs to calibrate LLM confidence,
detect hallucinations, and improve retrieval-augmented LLMs and their reasoning capabilities.

Enhancing Calibration and Hallucination Detection of LLMs As illustrated in Figure 20 (a), to calibrate
LLMs, an SLM processes both questions and LLM-generated answers to predict calibrated confidence. This training
involves minimizing the discrepancy between estimated calibration error and predicted confidence score. For instance,
APRICOT [343] uses an auxiliary DeBERTaV3 model [131] to assess LLM confidence in open-question scenarios, aiming
to improve uncertainty expression and response adjustment. Similarly, POLAR [450] has developed a self-supervised
approach that generates risk scores for each response to calibrate LLM confidence, utilizing a small BERT model [83] to
synchronize LLM outputs with other weak supervision sources. As shown in Figure 20 (b), for hallucination detection,
an SLM analyzes LLM internal states to output the likelihood of hallucination. This process uses supervised data
obtained by testing the knowledge boundaries of the LLM. In neural machine translation, Xu et al . [399] develop a
lightweight detector that analyzes token contributions to hallucinations, outperforming both model-free baselines and
quality estimation classifiers. Furthermore, SAPLMA [21] found that LLM internal states can signal the truthfulness of
statements, with a small BERT classifier trained to differentiate correct from incorrect predictions achieving accuracies
of 71% to 83%.

ally, as shown in Figure 21,SLMs can also serve as proxy models
to evaluate the familiarity of LLMs with user queries, determin-
ing whether LLMs need to retrieve additional information or
can respond directly. For example, SlimPLM [325] is a small
proxy model that assesses the necessity for LLM retrieval by

generating heuristic answers. High-quality responses indicate that LLMs can handle queries independently, whereas
lower-quality outputs require further retrieval. Additionally, Self-Knowledge Guided Retrieval (SKR) [365] enables
SLMs to autonomously decide when LLMs should operate independently, based on their self-assessment of knowledge
limitations. Further, SELF-RAG [18] improves the factual accuracy and quality of LLM outputs through on-demand
retrieval and self-reflection. This method employs a small critic language model to issue reflective markers and make
binary decisions regarding the need for further information retrieval. Moreover, some studies utilize SLMs to evaluate the
relevance of retrieved documents. LongLLMLingua [162] employs SLMs to calculate the relevance of documents to a
query 𝑥𝑞𝑢𝑒 using perplexity, as formalized by the equation:
𝑟𝑘 = −1
𝑁𝑐
∑︁
𝑖
log 𝑝SLM (𝑥𝑞𝑢𝑒
𝑖 |𝑥𝑑𝑜𝑐
𝑘 ), 𝑘 ∈{1,2,...,𝐾 } (2)
where 𝑥𝑞𝑢𝑒
𝑖 |𝑥𝑑𝑜𝑐
𝑘 ), 𝑘 ∈{1,2,...,𝐾 } (2)
where 𝑥𝑞𝑢𝑒
𝑖 is the 𝑖-th token in the query sequence, 𝑥𝑑𝑜𝑐
𝑘 is the retrieved document, and 𝑁𝑐 is the total number of
tokens in the query. 𝑝SLM represents the probability generated by an SLM. CRAG [401] employs SLMs as evaluators
of document relevance in the same way. RA-ISF [219] trains a small language model that checks the base LLM in
self-knowledge, relevance judgment, and question decomposition. In addition, some research employs SLMs as re-rankers
to refine the order of documents provided by initial retrieval efforts such as BM25 [ 291]. In-Context RALM [287] positions
SLMs as rankers, optimizing the document sequence with a fine-tuning process on RoBERTa [218] as defined by the
loss function:
min
𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑒𝑟
𝑘∑︁
𝑖=1
−log 𝑝rank (𝑑𝑖|𝑥≤𝑠𝑗 )·𝑝𝜃(𝑦|𝑑𝑖; 𝑥≤𝑠𝑗 ) (3)
where 𝑥≤𝑠𝑖 is a prefix sampled from the training data, 𝑦 = 𝑥𝑠𝑖 +1,...,𝑥 𝑠𝑖 +𝑠 represents the text to be generated in the
next stride, 𝑝𝜃(𝑦|𝑑𝑖; 𝑥≤𝑠𝑖)denotes the probability of the LLM generating 𝑦 given 𝑑𝑖 and 𝑥≤𝑠𝑖, and 𝑝rank (𝑑𝑖|𝑥≤𝑠𝑗 )is
the ranking score of 𝑑𝑖. Lastly, some studies leverage SLMs to retrieve sub-graphs when utilizing knowledge graphs as
external sources. Huang et al. [148] introduces the Generative Sub-graph Retriever (GSR) , which employs SLMs to
predict relation chains for answering questions, offering a cost-effective alternative to training LLMs. Specifically, it
uses customized T5 (220M, 770M, and 3B) [284] as retrievers to enhance LLM readers, including Llama2-chat-7B [339]
and Llama3-instruct-8B [94], on the WebQSP [418] and CWQ [324] datasets.

Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs As
illustrated in Figure 22, SLMs enhance LLMs reasoning
by transferring task knowledge to in-context examples,
effectively reducing hallucinations. While In-context
Learning (ICL) generally handles few-shot learning
with 16 to 32 examples, it struggles when faced with extensive supervised data. SLMs, specialized in task-specific
training, complement the broader domain knowledge of extensively pre-trained LLMs. For example, SuperICL [393]
incorporates SLMs as plugins for efficiently executing supervised tasks. It predicts labels for contextual examples and
integrates these predictions with the input text and actual labels to enhance knowledge transfer, thereby boosting
the understanding and responsiveness of LLMs. SuperContext [408] tackles challenges that LLMs encounter with
new tasks and out-of-distribution data in natural language understanding by synergizing SLM outputs with LLM
prompts during inference. This integration merges model predictions with their confidence levels, effectively leveraging
SLM task-specific knowledge and LLM domain expertise. Furthermore, SLMs efficiently decompose complex reasoning

and copyright infringement. As depicted in
Figure 23, SLMs can assist LLMs in address-
ing copyright and privacy concerns arising
from online data collection. By training on
selectively curated data subsets, SLMs effectively reduce copyright infringement and privacy risks, although they are
less effective than full-scale LLMs. To harness the combined benefits of both models, Li et al. [197] integrates untrusted
LLMs with benign SLMs using the CP-Δ KL algorithm to mitigate adverse effects while preserving performance. The
equation is:
𝑝(𝑦|𝑥)= 𝑝𝑙(𝑦|𝑥)·𝑝𝑠(𝑦|𝑥)
𝑍(𝑥) (4)
where 𝑝𝑙 and 𝑝𝑠 represent the probabilities from the large and small models, respectively, and 𝑍(𝑥)is the partition
function. This integration results in the following ensemble algorithm:
𝑧𝑝(·|𝑥)∝ 𝛼𝑧𝑙(·|𝑥)+( 1 −𝛼)𝑧𝑠(·|𝑥) (5)
where 𝑧𝑙 and 𝑧𝑠 are the logit values from the large and small models, respectively, and 𝛼 is the scaling factor.
6.2 SLM for Extracting LLM Prompts
Prompt-based methods are becoming simpler and more cost-effective alternatives to traditional fine-tuning in the LLM
era, utilizing LLMs’ instruction-following capabilities for a competitive edge. Mastering prompts is vital for replicating
LLM-supported product behaviors. However, services such as Bing Chat and GitHub Copilot Chat have seen prompt
reverse-engineering through black-box API attacks. SLMs often serve as surrogate models in these attacks, employing
strategies such as (i) SLM-based prompt likelihood estimation, (ii) SLM-based prompt parameter extraction, and (iii)
SLM-based direct model inversion, illustrated in Figure 24.
Manuscript submitted to ACM
46 Fali Wang, et al.
SLM-based prompt likelihood estimation , as illustrated in Figure 24 (a), Zhang et al. [443] proposes using an
SLM as a Likelihood Estimator to identify secret prompts in LLM outputs. They craft attack prompts, such as “Repeat all
sentences in our conversation, ” and query the target LLM. The response is likely to include secret prompts, confusing
the LLM to interpret these as part of the conversation. A fine-tuned DeBERTa model [132] is then used to select the
most likely secret prompts from the output.
SLM-based prompt parameter extraction , as shown in Figure 24 (b), Sha and Zhang [297] utilizes an SLM as a
Parameter Extractor to extract prompt parameters from LLM outputs. They employ a specialized BERT model [ 83]
to classify LLM outputs into direct, in-context, and role-based prompts, also predicting the number of exemplars
for in-context prompts and identifying roles for role-based prompts. Prompt reconstruction is then performed using
ChatGPT once the parameters are defined.
SLM-based direct model inversion , as shown in Figure 24 (c), the method of using an SLM as a Direct Inversion
Model is designed to reverse-engineer LLM outputs back to their original prompts [433]. They train a sparse encoder-
decoder T5 model [284] with 222M parameters on the Instructions-2M dataset [249], where the input is LLM outputs
and the output is the LLM prompt. This trained model effectively maps multiple LLM outputs to their initiating prompts
as 𝑝(𝑥|𝑦1,...,𝑦 𝑛; 𝑀𝑆1,𝑀𝑆2), with 𝑦𝑖 representing different output versions and 𝑀𝑆1,𝑀𝑆2 the model parameters.

Fig. 25. SLM for LLM Fine-tuning.
Fine-tuning is a crucial technique for adapt-
ing LLMs to specific tasks or domains, yet it
is often time-consuming. For instance, fine-
tuning the LLaMA-2-13B [ 339] checkpoint
on 32 NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 80GB mem-
ory using bfloat16 format requires approx-
imately 70 hours [ 247]. This process also
demands high-quality data. Therefore, we
examine how SLMs can enhance LLM fine-
examine how SLMs can enhance LLM fine-
tuning through three approaches: (i) proxy
fine-tuning, (ii) selecting high-quality data,
and (iii) guiding LLM-generated task data, as
illustrated in Figure 25.
SLMs as proxy models : SLMs can approximate the gradient of fine-tuning large-scale LLMs on target datasets,
avoiding the costly fine-tuning process in terms of time and computational resources. As shown in Figure 25 (a),
Emulated Fine-Tuning (EFT) [246] simulates both unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning stages across
different scales by manipulating log probabilities. EFT, for example, combines base log probabilities from a 70B model
with behavioral deltas from a 7B model—these deltas represent differences between fine-tuned and unfine-tuned SLMs,
effectively emulating outcomes for the Llama-2 series. This method allows fine-tuning on smaller models such as
Falcon-7B [10] while capturing most benefits of fine-tuning larger models such as Falcon-180B, benefiting applications
such as dialogue, question-answering, and code generation. Similarly, Proxy-tuning [212] adjusts LLM predictions by
adding the differences between the outputs of a fine-tuned small model and its untuned version to the LLM’s output
vocabulary during decoding, maintaining the advantages of large-scale pre-training while integrating small-scale

fine-tuning benefits. Moreover, SLMs can act as proxies for approximate LLM fine-tuning during decoding. Weak-
to-Strong Search [453] strategy frames the alignment of LLMs as a test-time greedy search, aiming to maximize the
log-probability difference between small tuned and untuned models while sampling from the frozen large model. This
approach serves as a dual-purpose method: (1) a compute-efficient model up-scaling strategy that circumvents direct
tuning of the large model, and (2) an instance of weak-to-strong generalization that bolsters a strong model with weak
test-time guidance.
SLMs play a role in selecting high-quality fine-tuning data for LLMs. Figure 25 (b) illustrates how SLMs within
the same family as the LLM can identify training samples that are likely to be challenging, enhancing the training
efficiency and generalization capability of the LLM. As demonstrated by Swayamdipta et al. [323] and further advanced
by Mekala et al. [242], the learning percentage 𝐿𝑃(𝑖)is a metric used to curate high-quality datasets with hard samples:
𝐿𝑃(𝑖)= 𝑃𝑖−1 −𝑃𝑖
𝑃0 −𝑃𝑛 where 𝑃𝑖 represents the perplexity at the end of epoch- 𝑖, and 𝑃0 is the initial perplexity. A higher
𝐿𝑃(𝑖)early in training indicates significant learning in the initial epochs, highlighting the potential of these samples to
enhance LLMs. SmallToLarge (S2L) [411] utilizes training loss trajectories from smaller models to guide data selection
for larger models fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that S2L significantly enhances data efficiency in SFT
for mathematical problem-solving, reducing the required training data to just 11% of the original MathInstruct dataset
[428] to achieve performance comparable to that obtained using the full dataset.
SLMs enhance the quality of LLM-generated data for specific tasks. As depicted in Figure 25 (c), CROSSLM
[79] promotes the local training of SLMs on client-specific private data to mitigate privacy risks associated with
server-based LLMs. An SLM trained in this manner can guide the server-side LLM to produce high-quality synthetic
datasets. Feedback from SLMs regarding the quality of this synthetic data serves as a supervisory signal, enhancing
both the quality of LLM outputs and the utility of the data for further training.

LLMs are utilized across various applications due to their open-ended
generation capabilities, yet they often lack specialized knowledge and
other generation issues. SLMs can supplement this by providing task-
specific knowledge or reflecting weaknesses. Therefore, we explore
how SLMs enhance the performance of LLMs in specific applications,
focusing on open-ended generation, knowledge integration, relation
extraction, and empathetic response.
In open-ended text generation —such as writing assistance and
story creation—LLMs often suffer from issues such as incoherence and
thematic drift over extended sequences. Due to more frequent failure
patterns observed in SLMs, such as short, repeated, and irrelevant
strings, these patterns serve as negative examples for LLM decoding.
Contrastive Decoding (CD) [198] improves coherence and lexical diversity by leveraging the differential capabilities
between a large model, OPT-13B [ 440], and a smaller model, OPT-125M. As illustrated in Figure 26, CD improves
content quality by sampling generation based on the difference in log probabilities, log 𝑝𝐸𝑋𝑃 −log 𝑝𝐴𝑀𝐴, between an
expert LM and an amateur LM, rather than relying solely on the expert LM’s log probability. This approach effectively
reduces generative failures, including repetition.

Fig. 27. BLADE Framework [189].
In knowledge injection , general LLMs may lack
domain-specific expertise for specialized tasks like law
or medicine [91, 353]. Domain-specific SLMs can sup-
ply crucial knowledge in a format suitable for LLMs.
To this end, BLADE [189] integrates black-box LLMs
with small domain-specific models. BLADE combines
the comprehensive language capabilities of LLMs with
the specialized knowledge of small LMs. As shown in
Figure 27, BLADE’s process includes: 1) pre-training SLMs on domain-specific data, 2) fine-tuning with knowledge
instruction to meet task-specific needs, and 3) using joint Bayesian optimization to enhance synergy between the LLM
and the small LM, boosting overall performance.
In relation extraction , a field limited by scarce labeled data and prevalent long-tail categories, the “Train-Guide-
Predict” framework [327] employs SLMs to learn task-specific knowledge for dominant categories. SLMs struggle
with rare categories, whereas LLMs manage these effectively due to their extensive pre-trained text. Therefore, this
framework leverages the strengths of both models: it utilizes SLMs to acquire task knowledge and guide the LLM’s
generative process with initial SLM predictions, enhancing the LLM’s handling of underrepresented categories.
In generating empathetic responses , LLMs excel in expressiveness but struggle with nuanced emotions and
cognition. HEF [413] addresses this by incorporating Small Empathy Models (SEMs) to enhance LLMs’ emotional and
cognitive depth. This framework employs a two-tiered emotion prediction method: SEMs identify primary emotions,
directing LLMs to concentrate on these emotions and their triggers, resulting in more accurate and empathetic responses.
6.5 SLM for LLM Safety
As demonstrated by various works [250, 302, 426, 460], LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and jailbreaking.
For example, Wang et al. [358] shows that ChatGPT’s performance on adversarial datasets is still far from perfect,
indicating that potential risks of adversarial vulnerability remain. Another example includes jailbreaking ChatGPT
by asking it to ’pretend to be a sarcastic mean girl. ’ Using such techniques, it has been shown that even the most
advanced LLMs are far from being safe against generating potentially harmful content. Hence, the widely adopted
LLM-based services to generate are at high risk of being misused for nefarious purposes. Consequently, resources
such as the Llama 2 Responsible Use Guide 14 strongly advocate for implementing robust guardrails in products that
utilize Generative AI. These guardrails are specifically designed to mitigate risks associated with both inputs to and
outputs from the model, ensuring safeguards against the generation of high-risk or policy-violating content, as well as
protecting against adversarial inputs and attempts to compromise the model. In addition to developing trustworthy
LLMs, adopting SLMs for LLM safety [153, 177] has also attracted increasing attention. For example, Llama Guard [153],
fine-tuned on Llama2-7B, has publicly released an input-output safeguard tool specifically for classifying safety risks in
prompts and responses within conversational AI applications. However, this tool is limited to assessing the harmfulness
of questions and answers and does not facilitate the generation of fluent, safe responses. In response to this limitation,
Kwon et al. [177] fine-tune a specialized small language model with harmful query detection and safeguard answer
generation tasks to accurately detect harmful user queries and generate appropriate safeguard explanations, thereby
enhancing the safety measures in conversational AI.

6.6 SLM for LLM Evaluation
SLMs can also enhance the evaluation of LLMs. In dialog evaluation, generating dialog reference responses is computa-
tionally complex, making accurate assessment difficult due to the multiple plausible but semantically different responses
possible for a single dialog context. Relying on LLM prompting for evaluation can lead to problems such as dependency
on prompt wording and inconsistent results. One solution involves training specialized SLMs to evaluate LLMs, as these
SLMs can be fine-tuned more quickly and generate outputs faster during inference, owing to their reduced number
of parameters. For example, SLIDE [449] employs contrastive learning to fine-tune an SLM to effectively distinguish
between positive and negative responses. Based on its observation that SLMs are more accurate in identifying positive
responses and LLMs excel at classifying negative ones, the trained SLM is subsequently integrated with an LLM to
assign a score to each response. The scoring method used is formalized as follows:
𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 =
 

𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑆𝐿𝑀 , if 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑆𝐿𝑀 ≥0.5
𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝐿𝐿𝑀 , elif 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝐿𝐿𝑀 < 0.5
𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 𝑆𝐿𝑀 +𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 𝐿𝐿𝑀
2 , otherwise
(6)
This equation allows for adaptive response evaluation, leveraging the strengths of both models to ensure a more
reliable and consistent assessment across varying dialogue contexts. In the natural language generation task, Kuhn
et al. [175] designs a novel entropy to evaluate the uncertainty of LLMs. It aims to tackle the challenge of semantic
equivalence [175]. For instance, A’s son is B and B is A’s son are semantically equivalent. It should not be considered
uncertain if an LLM is unsure about which of the two previously mentioned sentences to generate due to semantic
equivalence. A DeBERTa-Large [132] fine-tuned on the MNLI [378] dataset serves as the classifier guided by semantic
equivalence in the clustering stage. SelfCheckGPT [240] proposes a black-box hallucination detection method for
LLMs. The core idea is to leverage uncertainty derived from sampled outputs. To be specific, Manakul et al. [240] claim
that an LLM trained on a concept generates responses that are similar and factually consistent. One of the five variants
of SelfCheckGPT uses BertScore to achieve it. A DeBERTa-Large [218] is utilized to calculate the BERTScore. Factscore
[244] is proposed to evaluate the factuality of LM-generated long-form content. It divides the generated long content
into multiple short texts, enabling a more precise assessment of factual accuracy. In addition to manual evaluation, Min
et al. [244] also proposes an automated evaluation framework to estimate Factscore which can reduce costs. LLaMa
7B [338] fine-tuned on Super-NaturalInstructions [ 367] is one of the LMs employed as an evaluation assistant and
shows promising performance. They also employ Generalizable T5-based dense retrievers [259] to facilitate passage
retrieval.
Insights: SLMs can improve LLMs in various aspects, including enhancing the reliability of LLM generation, extracting prompts, fine-tuning,
application, and evaluation. This discussion seeks to answer when SLMs should be utilized to augment LLMs. We identify several suitable
scenarios:
• Adapting LLMs to specific tasks can require substantial computational resources and time. In such cases, a smaller model could be fine-tuned
instead to serve functions such as hallucination detection.
• SLMs can outperform LLMs in certain aspects, hence combining SLMs with LLMs can create a more powerful model, e.g., SLMs typically
have fewer security issues than LLMs, and integrating both can generate a model that is both powerful and secure.
• SLMs, despite their limitations, can alert LLMs to these issues, such as the tendency to produce repetitive vocabulary. Designing contrastive
losses can help LLMs overcome these issues by learning from the nuanced feedback of SLMs.
• The fast inference speed and certain characteristics of SLMs can emulate and thus enhance the behavior of LLMs, acting as effective proxies.
For example, the training data selection for LLMs can be guided by the difficulty metrics assessed by SLMs, and the parameter adjustments
during the fine-tuning of SLMs can also approximate the fine-tuning processes of LLMs.

devices, enabling rapid responses and low latency for straightforward tasks. LLMs, on the other hand, possess greater
computational power and a deeper understanding of complex language patterns, allowing them to handle more intricate
and nuanced tasks. By integrating SLMs and LLMs, systems can dynamically allocate tasks based on complexity,
ensuring that simple queries are processed quickly on the edge while more demanding requests are escalated to the
cloud. This collaborative approach optimizes resource usage, reduces operational costs, and maintains high-quality
outputs across a diverse range of applications. The synergy between small and large language models can be categorized
into two parts: cloud-edge synergy and task-centric synergy . Cloud-edge synergy refers to a setup where SLMs operate
on edge devices, while LLMs reside on the server. When the SLM is not powerful enough, the LLM compensates by
handling more complex tasks and providing additional support. Task-centric synergy refers to the scenario where SLMs
and LLMs leverage their respective strengths to improve task-oriented efficiency. Table 13 summarizes representative
work in each category and their key points. Next, we introduce each category in detail.

7.1 Cloud-Edge Synergy
The current utilization of LLMs typically involves uploading private data to the cloud for response. Fine-tuning LLMs
usually also requires uploading data to clouds for computing. However, this raises privacy concerns as the collection
and usage of private data are constrained by personal privacy awareness and legal regulations [348]. Consequently, the
cloud-edge synergy between SLMs and LLMs is proposed to alleviate this issue, i.e., SLMs handle privacy-sensitive data
locally, LLMs handle de-identified or non-privacy-sensitive data, and these two models collaborate. This section discusses
such cloud-edge synergy, dividing them into two categories: cloud-edge synergy during inference and cloud-edge
synergy during training, as shown in Figure 28.
Cloud-edge Synergy During Inference. CoGenesis [437] breaks down the user instruction into a general section
and a personal section. The LLM generates replies solely based on general instruction, and the SLM considers both user
instruction and additional personal context for its output generation. A fusion strategy blends the output of LLM and
SLM synergistically.Xu et al. [397] introduces a split learning system for LLM agents in 6G networks, optimizing mobile
device and cloud server collaboration. Mobile devices operate lightweight SLMs with 0–10B parameters for real-time
tasks, while cloud servers handle larger LLMs with over 10B parameters for complex reasoning and planning. This setup
allows efficient local task management on mobile devices and offloads heavy operations to cloud servers. The system’s
architecture features three modules—perception, grounding, and alignment—facilitating effective communication to
meet the sophisticated needs of 6G networks.
Besides these frameworks, more specific models are proposed to facilitate the cloud-edge synergy. A common
strategy is to use SLM’s fast decoding ability. LLM-to-SLM [28] proposes a framework in which the pre-trained frozen
encoder-decoder LLM resides on the server and computes a high-quality representation of the prompt for the planning
of an appropriate response. The SLM residing on the edge device, conditioned on this representation, decodes the
response efficiently. Some variants put more emphasis on the reasoning ability of LLMs [167, 234, 298]. In Synergy
of Thoughts [298], the SLMs generate multiple low-cost reasoning paths. If these paths conflict, the larger LLMs
are invoked to provide reflective reasoning and correct any intuitive errors. Hao et al . [127] proposes a framework
in which an SLM residing on the edge devices generates tokens, calling LLMs to verify and correct threshold-gated
"harder" tokens, to achieve a controllable trade-off between inference quality and cost. LLMCad [394] presents an
on-device inference engine addressing memory and latency issues in deploying LLMs on mobile devices. It combines a
lightweight LM for token generation with a high-precision LLM for verification, leveraging a token tree structure and
speculative generation for efficiency. Tested on devices such as Jetson TX2, it achieves up to 9.3× speedup for LLMs
with over 10 billion parameters while maintaining accuracy.
Cloud-edge Synergy During Training. CROSSLM [79] introduces a client-server collaborative training framework
that preserves data privacy by having clients locally train SLMs instead of fine-tuning LLMs. The framework enables
mutual enhancement through a feedback loop where SLMs evaluate LLM-generated synthetic data and provide feedback
to improve the LLM’s generative capabilities, ensuring high-quality and task-specific data. Concurrently, the synthetic
data trains the SLMs, boosting their performance. This cyclical exchange fosters cloud-edge synergy and mutual model
improvement.
7.2 Task-Centric Synergy
The advent of LLMs has significantly propelled various natural language processing tasks and inspired research into
their synergistic interactions with SLMs to enhance the performance of models tailored for specific tasks. This section
Manuscript submitted to ACM
52 Fali Wang, et al.
introduces scenarios where small language models exhibit specialized capabilities after fine-tuning and discusses how
combining their unique strengths with the versatile abilities of LLMs can yield superior performance on specific tasks.
For example, LLMs excel at handling difficult examples or can rewrite content to eliminate task-irrelevant redundancy,
thereby enhancing overall task performance, as illustrated in Figure 29, 30 and 31.

𝛼-UMi [307] introduces a multi-agent framework to en-

LMs—planner, caller, and summarizer—as depicted in Figure
29—each handling specific subtasks such as planning, tool invo-
cation, and summarization. This modular design allows the use of small and large open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMa-7B/12B)
and supports easy tool updates. Evaluated on benchmarks like ToolBench [279] and ToolAlpaca [326], 𝛼-UMi outper-
forms traditional single-LLM methods and even exceeds GPT-4 in tool learning performance.

SynCID [204] focuses on Conversational Intent Discovery
(CID), a task where both known and new intents must be iden-

combines LLMs’ deep semantic insights with SLMs’ agility and
specialized capabilities. As illustrated in Figure 30, the frame-
work uses LLM prompting to refine discourse and intent labels,
enhancing semantic accuracy and assigning new labels to un-
labeled data. SLMs are trained via contrastive learning to align
semantic spaces of discourse and intent descriptors, reducing clustering distortion and improving new intent detection.
Tested on BANKING [43], CLINC [179], and StackOverflow [396], SynCID outperforms CID baselines significantly.

samples, minimizing reliance on LLMs and reducing latency and costs; for those difficult samples, the top N predicted
candidate labels from the SLM are passed to the LLM for reranking (predicting). Tested on small-sample IE tasks, this
approach improves performance by an average of 2.4% compared to previous methods. Data Shunt+ (DS+) [46] intro-

It incorporates S4L and L4S modules with Prompt Pruning (PP) and 2-stage Confidence Distillation (2CD) for better
input processing and knowledge transfer. Tests show DS+ outperforms fine-tuning in accuracy and cost efficiency,

8 TRUSTWORTHINESS IN SMALL LANGUAGE MODELS
8 TRUSTWORTHINESS IN SMALL LANGUAGE MODELS
Language models have become ubiquitous in our daily lives, and we increasingly rely on them. However, they pose risks
regarding their limitations in trustworthy dimensions like privacy and fairness. These concerns are especially critical
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare [130] and finance [202]. Consequently, numerous studies have emerged
to evaluate the trustworthiness of LMs [88, 95, 138, 176, 176, 248, 254, 273, 351, 370, 425]. In this section, we consider
the works that benchmark various LMs’ trustworthiness and omit the specific attack methods [ 41, 53, 150, 461] or
work [407] that only focuses on early pre-trained LMs like BERT [83] as they are already covered in previous survey
papers [78, 115, 123, 288]. Inspired by previous works [320, 351], we discuss the following five key trustworthy scenarios:
robustness, privacy, reliability, safety , and fairness, as shown in Figure 32. We consider two dimensions for robustness:
Adversarial (Adv) Robustness [352] and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Robustness [38, 213]. For safety, we explore two key
concerns: Misinformation [344] and Toxicity [374]. For reliability, we focus on Hallucination [146] and Sycophancy [301].
Please note that these are just the aspects we are focusing on, and therefore this is not a comprehensive classification or
taxonomy. For example, robustness also contains robustness to adversarial demonstration.
Though there are a lot of works benchmarking LMs’ trustworthiness, their main focus is on LLMs. Therefore, we
survey some representative works evaluating the trustworthiness of LMs, focusing specifically on those that include
SLMs of around 7B parameters or smaller. We also summarize these works in Table 14. Next, we briefly introduce them.
Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) [205] benchmarks a large number of LMs from various aspects,
including a lot of metrics related to trustworthiness such as robustness and fairness. Do-Not-Answer [364] introduces a
dataset to evaluate how LMs act when they face content that should not be answered. Wang et al. [364] also label the
output of several LMs output on their dataset and then use the labeled data to train some classifiers. PromptRobust [456]
constructs two kinds of adversarial prompts to evaluate LMs’ robustness: One kind is designed under non-adversarial
settings with semantic integrity while another category is created under adversarial settings. Their results show that
LMs perform poorly under such prompts. HaluEval [191] builds a dataset comprising both the samples generated by their
proposed framework and human-labeled hallucinations. It facilitates analysis of when LMs produce hallucinated output
and how well they detect hallucinated content. Then they use some strategies such as knowledge retrieval to help LMs
better recognize hallucinations. Mo et al. [248] evaluates the trustworthiness of open-source LMs, presenting a variety
of scenarios such as fairness and privacy. Results show that smaller LMs sometimes outperform larger ones in terms of
trustworthiness. PrivLM-Bench [190] is designed to evaluate the privacy issues in LMs. It enables a fair comparison of
privacy-preserving LMs by considering more than just differential privacy parameters. FFT [71] introduces around two
thousand crafted examples to evaluate LMs’ performances on three trustworthy dimensions: factuality, fairness, and
toxicity. Their results suggest that larger LMs do not always show better harmlessness. ROBBIE [98] first benchmarks
various series of LMs using a lot of datasets, including two newly introduced datasets developed by ROBBIE. It also

evaluates mitigation techniques designed to reduce bias and toxicity. TrustLLM [320] is a comprehensive benchmark
that contains a large number of datasets and various well-designed metrics to systematically evaluate various LMs across
multiple trustworthy dimensions, including truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and machine ethics. They
also carefully design specific subcategories for each dimension. RAmBLA [35] evaluates the trustworthiness of four LMs
as biomedical assistants from three dimensions: Robustness, High Recall, and Hallucination. RAmBLA suggests LMs
with more parameters are less likely to cause hallucinations and may choose to reject providing an answer in uncertain
situations. JailbreakBench [45] constructs a jailbreaking dataset named JBB-Behaviors and jailbreak artifacts to evaluate
current LMs’ performance regarding jailbreaking. It also proposes a unified evaluation pipeline that can incorporate
new jailbreak defense techniques. Xie et al. [390] tests online safety analysis methods, filling the gap where no methods
focus on the generation phase. OR-Bench [ 70] constructs three datasets: OR-Bench-80K, OR-Bench-Hard-1K, and
OR-Bench-Toxic, to systematically evaluate over-refusal problems in LMs, emphasizing the challenge of balancing
safety alignment with the models’ usefulness. SORRY-Bench [387] systematically tests 43 different LMs to see how they
perform when facing requests that should be refused. They also collect more than annotations created by humans and
find that fine-tuned 7B LMs can achieve performance comparable to GPT-4 scale LMs as evaluators. BeHonest [59]
evaluates the honesty of LMs from three aspects: Self-Knowledge, Non-Deceptiveness, and Consistency. They use
many different metrics for each aspect. For example, sycophancy rate and lying rate are adopted in Non-Deceptiveness.
The results in both the Self-Knowledge and Consistency parts reveal that larger model sizes generally bring improved
performance for the Llama-2 [ 339] and Llama-3 [ 94] series. Hong et al . [138] examines the effects of compression

methods, including quantization and pruning, on the trustworthiness of language models. They find that pruning and
extreme quantization significantly affect the trustworthiness of LMs. RUPBench [370] comprises 15 reasoning datasets
designed to assess the performance of LMs both in normal conditions and under various adversarial perturbations. Their
results indicate that larger LMs generally demonstrate better resilience to perturbations. Nakka et al. [254] investigates
the trust and ethical implications of SLMs deployed on personal devices. It reveals the vulnerabilities of on-device SLMs
compared with their on-server counterparts.
Please note that the dimensions discussed in this section reflect only those relevant to our current focus; additional
dimensions may be discussed in those works, but not listed in table 14. For example, TrustLLM [ 320] also explores

9 FUTURE DIRECTIONS
In this section, we offer insights into several promising future research directions that could inspire and motivate the
community to address existing gaps in the development of small language models.
9.1 Developing Efficient SLM Model Architecture
Although Transformers [346] are foundational in most language models, they face significant computational and
memory challenges that worsen with model size, impacting training and autoregressive decoding. Recently, Mamba
[117] has emerged as a promising alternative, adapting state space models to dynamically select inputs based on
demands, thereby enhancing efficiency. Thereafter, xLSTM [25] demonstrates that an improved LSTM could function as
an LLM, revealing the potential of traditional SSMs. The integration of global static information captured by SSMs with
the dynamic information processing of Transformers could complement each other, leading to new architectures that
balance effectiveness and efficiency.
balance effectiveness and efficiency.
9.2 Addressing SLM Training Inefficiencies
One study [ 85] explores the disparate learning dynamics between small and large language models. Utilizing the
Pythia model suite, the research demonstrates that layers’ activations in larger models converge more rapidly and
monotonically to their final states. This phenomenon is associated with a higher proportional effective rank (PER) in the
parameters and gradients of larger models. The analysis enhances our understanding of training inefficiencies in small
models and provides insights for future efforts, such as developing methods to increase the PER of layers’ parameters.
9.3 Expanding Domain-Specific SLMs
Domain-specific SLMs, which are tailored for specific fields, can provide a stronger foundation for relevant downstream
tasks than general-purpose models. Currently, these models primarily focus on scientific and healthcare domains.
However, there is significant potential for expansion into other key areas such as law, finance, education, telecommuni-
cations, and transportation. The scarcity of SLMs that cater to these domains presents an urgent call for research into
developing more specialized models.
9.4 Establishing Benchmarking and Leaderboard Platforms for SLMs
Several compelling reasons justify the establishment of benchmarking and leaderboard platforms for SLMs. Firstly, most
state-of-the-art SLMs are trained on proprietary datasets, which may include test sets from existing evaluation tasks,
presenting challenges for fair capability comparisons. Secondly, many SLMs are designed for specific device applications,
Manuscript submitted to ACM
56 Fali Wang, et al.
significantly differing from general open-domain tasks. Thus, there is a lack of comprehensive benchmarks that
accurately reflect SLM performance in specific device applications. For example, SLMs deployed on smartphones often
handle tasks sensitive to user data, such as auto-replies based on historical chat texts or GUI context understanding—tasks
not typically included in current benchmarks, potentially leading to an underestimation of their importance. Finally,
current evaluation tasks focus primarily on metrics like accuracy. Evaluating on-device SLMs involves balancing
multiple factors, including overall capabilities, response times, storage and memory usage, power consumption, CPU
utilization, additional fine-tuning requirements, and context window constraints, making comprehensive and detailed
assessments essential.
9.5 Enhancing SLM Performance and Efficiency
9.5 Enhancing SLM Performance and Efficiency
In terms of enhancing SLM performance and efficiency, the efficiency of using teacher LLMs via instruction tuning can
be further developed, such as Efficient Instruction Tuning of SLMs from LLMs-generated data, Optimizing Teacher LLM
Selection for SLM Learning, and Applying Emerging Techniques from LLMs to SLMs.
•Efficient Instruction Tuning of SLMs from LLMs-generated data. Enhancing the specialization of SLMs through
instruction tuning from LLMs-generated data is crucial, yet finding the most cost-effective instructional strategies
remains an underexplored status. Some key areas for exploration are:
(1) Instruction Design Adaptability : The performance of LLMs and SLMs varies significantly with changes in instruc-
tions. Therefore, designing tailored instructions that effectively activate relevant sub-competencies and reasoning
pathways in SLMs for specific tasks is crucial. This approach would optimize their ability to utilize instructional data,
representing a significant future research direction.
(2) SLM Capability Adaptability : Given that SLMs exhibit diverse capabilities across domains, simply supplying
extensive data samples for instruction tuning is often inefficient, as SLMs may spend excessive time processing
unnecessary data. To optimize efficiency when adapting to specific domains, we suggest first assessing the intrinsic
capabilities of an SLM within those domains. Subsequently, one could select appropriate data and activate essential
fine-grained capabilities to effectively adapt to domain shifts. This targeted approach ensures efficient and domain-
specific instruction tuning.
(3) Optimizing Data Efficiency : SLMs may possess missing or latent domain knowledge, and activating this latent
knowledge may not require substantial data. Thus, identifying inherent knowledge within SLMs and determining the
minimal data necessary for effective fine-tuning is a future direction. This research aims to optimize performance
while minimizing training resources.
•Optimizing Teacher LLM Selection for SLM Learning. Teacher LLMs with different abilities and knowledge
facilitate diverse applications for SLM training, including data rewriting and generation. Selecting the appropriate
teacher model based on specific use cases is crucial. This process requires evaluating the teacher’s capabilities and
knowledge to ensure optimal application. For example, GPT-4 excels in generating domain-specific data, outperforming
ChatGPT, which may produce inferior outcomes. Strategic selection of teacher LLMs is essential for future work to
ensure their strengths are effectively utilized to enhance SLM performance.
•Applying Emerging Techniques from LLMs to SLMs. To improve LLM performance, techniques such as Retrieval-
Augmented Generation (RAG) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) are employed. The adoption of RAG in SLMs shows
significant promise [215], suggesting benefits from further tailoring retrieved information for SLMs. Future research
should account for SLMs’ constraints, such as limited context windows, and customize RAG accordingly. MoE uses
Manuscript submitted to ACM
A Survey of Small Language Models 57
multiple experts to enhance learning without increasing active neurons, but its storage demands pose challenges
for SLM deployment, making this a promising area for exploration. Additionally, the application of LLM techniques
such as in-context learning and prompting engineering to maximize SLM performance, while accounting for SLMs’
constraints, warrants further investigation.
9.6 Applications of SLMs
9.6 Applications of SLMs
In real-world applications, SLMs often need to provide personalized services and need to be updated periodically
to reflect new needs and new knowledge. Hence, there are several promising directions in terms of the real-world
application of SLMs, which are listed as follows:
•LoRA for Personalized Services. Companies often provide personalized services, but user-specific complexities
can render simple rules ineffective. Training a separate SLM for each user is impractical. LoRA suggests a method of
separable training weights alongside fixed original weights, enabling scalable customization. For instance, RecLoRA
[455] integrates personalized knowledge into SLMs/LLMs tailored for recommendation tasks by maintaining a set of
parallel, independent LoRA weights. This approach effectively customizes language model parameters to align with
individual user preferences. This approach is a promising direction that inspires further investigation.
•Lifelong On-device Learning for Knowledge Injection. SLMs on devices can access local data without risking
data privacy through two main methods. The first method uses retrieval-augmented generation to integrate local data
into prompts, requiring SLMs with advanced processing and reasoning capabilities. The second method fine-tunes
SLMs with local data, integrating customized knowledge into the model’s weights. However, this approach demands
significant device resources, including memory and energy. A promising solution is lifelong learning, where SLMs
continuously learn and adapt while in use.
•Strategic Use of SLMs and LLMs in Multi-Agent Systems. LLMs can function as agents; however, their extensive
capabilities are often underutilized in many scenarios, leading to resource wastage. Consequently, strategically
routing to appropriately capable SLMs and LLMs within multi-agent systems can optimize cost and functionality.
9.7 Multimodal SLMs
Research on small language models also includes multimodal data. For example, SmolVLM [99] is a compact model
that handles image and text inputs to produce text outputs, suitable for on-device use and various multimodal tasks.
SOLO [54] integrates vision and language processing in a single 7B Transformer model. The limited scope of existing
research on multimodal SLMs provides a compelling impetus for researchers to investigate the integration of various
modalities, including audio and graphs.
9.8 SLMs Assisting LLMs
In Section 6, we introduced existing works on the use of SLMs to assist LLMs. For instance, EFT [ 246] emulates
fine-tuning on LLMs by leveraging behavior deltas between SLMs’ pre-trained and fine-tuned weights to alleviate
the time-cost issues associated with fine-tuning LLMs; SlimPLM [ 325] detects missing knowledge in LLMs using a
slim proxy SLM to accelerate knowledge injection; Contrastive Decoding [198] enhances text quality by maximizing
the difference between the log probabilities of an expert LLM and an amateur SLM to mitigate issues of low-quality
generation. The research on adopting SLMs to assist LLMs is still in its early stages, with many promising directions
yet to be explored. We list some as follows:
yet to be explored. We list some as follows:

•Enhancing LLM Performance Across Broader Tasks Through SLM Integration. SLMs can outperform LLMs in
certain scenarios. For example, SLMs often present fewer security vulnerabilities compared to their larger counterparts
and demonstrate superior performance on easier samples in specific tasks [197, 234]. Therefore, integrating SLMs
with LLMs can promote the development of models that are not only more robust but also inherently safer. Currently,
research in this domain is relatively sparse, suggesting that this collaborative framework could potentially be applied
to a wider array of tasks.
•Efficient Enhancement of LLMs through Proxy SLMs. Existing research [18, 212, 246, 325] indicates that SLMs,
owing to their accelerated fine-tuning and inference speeds, can effectively mimic the behaviors of LLMs, thereby
serving as efficient proxies for optimization. However, the application of SLMs as operational proxies for LLMs is
currently underexplored. This mimicry could potentially be expanded to include various aspects of LLM functionality,
such as the optimization of prompts, the filtration and integration of supplementary knowledge, and the management
of additional knowledge repositories.
•SLMs Assist in Managing Data Quality. LLMs tend to produce hallucinations and toxic content due to low-quality
real-world training data. One solution is to remove these low-quality data [ 355]. However, directly eliminating
low-quality content can diminish certain functionalities of LLMs, such as versatility [356]. Therefore, it is crucial to
define more refined data quality assessment criteria across dimensions such as factuality, safety, and diversity [377]
for real-world data. Researching efficient data selection methods using small models represents a valuable research
direction. Additionally, while synthetic data serves as a vital complement to scarce human-generated data [224], the
potential for small models to effectively manage synthetic data remains largely unexplored.
•SLMs Assist in LLM Assessment. LLMs are producing vast amounts of increasingly complex texts, such as
specialized code and scientific papers, presenting challenges not only for human evaluators but also for traditional
assessment metrics. Consequently, developing effective evaluators to assess various aspects of generated content,
including factuality, safety, and uncertainty, becomes crucial. Given their proficiency in handling specific tasks,
exploring the potential of SLMs to evaluate LLM outputs is a promising research direction.
•SLMs Optimize Query and Reduce Noise for LLM RAG. For Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LLMs,
differing query requirements between LLMs and search engines pose a challenge. The query for LLMs is often abstract
and difficult for search engines to handle, so they require more detailed query keywords. Moreover, LLMs may not
need all the information related to a query because they only require partial additional knowledge. Thus, intermediate
agents are crucial to adapting LLM queries for search engines by clarifying the required detailed keywords that can
search for necessary extra knowledge. Additionally, search engine outputs contain noises, requiring refinement to
boost LLM efficiency. SLMs, skilled in a single task, are ideal for optimizing query rewriting and noise reduction in
RAG systems, making their application in LLM RAG a promising research area.
•SLMs safeguard LLM. Resources such as the Llama 2 Responsible Use Guide strongly advocate for the implementation
of robust guardrails in products that utilize Generative AI. SLMs can be strategically designed to serve as such
guardrails, mitigating risks associated with both inputs and outputs from the model. This approach ensures safeguards
against the generation of high-risk or policy-violating content and provides protection against adversarial inputs
and attempts to compromise the model. Future research can investigate the various safety roles that SLMs play in
protecting LLMs.

9.9 Synergy between Small and Large Language Models
In Section 7, we discussed how small and large language models can complement each other. For example, CoGenesis
[437] integrates SLMs for private data and LLMs for broader context, while Synergy of Thoughts [298] uses SLMs for
initial reasoning and LLMs for conflict resolution. CROSSLM [79] shows how privacy can be preserved by training
SLMs locally to support LLMs without data exposure. Research in this area is still evolving, and we outline several
promising future directions below:
•Refined Cloud-Edge Division of Labor. Current research mainly focuses on splitting tasks between edge-based
SLMs and cloud-based LLMs along privacy-sensitive and non-sensitive data boundaries. A potential future direction
involves more granular task partitioning: determining which subtasks should be handled locally by SLMs (e.g.,
initial data filtering, quick semantic parsing) and which should be delegated to the cloud-based LLM (e.g., advanced
reasoning, complex generation). This approach can further optimize latency, privacy, and resource utilization.
•Adaptive On-Device Specialization for Dynamic Environments. Although SLMs have shown the ability to
handle private or personalized data locally, continuous changes in user preferences, application requirements, and
data distributions pose challenges. Future work can explore adaptive strategies where edge-based SLMs dynamically
specialize or update their parameters, guided by the cloud-based LLM. For instance, the LLM can periodically distill
new knowledge into the SLM or provide feedback signals to help the SLM adapt to evolving scenarios.
9.10 Trustworthy SLMs
As SLMs are playing crucial roles in various aspects, understanding and improving the trustworthiness of SLMs are
essential. Hence, two promising directions are:
•A Comprehensive Evaluation of SLMs’ Trustworthiness. While numerous studies address trustworthiness
issues in LLMs, research on SLMs remains sparse. Most existing literature focuses on models with at least 7 billion
parameters, leaving a gap in the comprehensive analysis of SLMs’ trustworthiness. Current evaluations typically
cover only a fraction of the necessary aspects. Therefore, a systematic assessment, such as TrustLLM [320], is essential
to thoroughly evaluate the trustworthiness of SLMs and understand their reliability across various applications.
•Developing Trustworthy SLMs. Developing trustworthy SLMs is crucial, with three key research directions: (i)
Training SLMs to be trustworthy from scratch; (ii) Ensuring SLMs retain or gain trustworthiness when compressed
from LLMs—maintaining trustworthiness if the LLM is trustworthy and instilling trustworthiness if it is not; (iii)
Fine-tuning non-trustworthy SLMs to enhance their robustness.
10 CONCLUSION
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of Small Language Models (SLMs) with up to 7 billion parameters. Initially,
we address the need to clearly define SLMs due to existing ambiguities in their characterization. We then present the
foundational concepts essential for constructing SLMs. The survey progresses to explore enhancement techniques,
including knowledge distillation and quantization, as well as strategies for adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to
SLM contexts. We survey representative SLMs, both general-domain and domain-specific, discussing their preferred
datasets and architectural decisions. We also assess their applications across various tasks and deployment strategies
on devices. Further, we investigate their role in augmenting the capabilities of LLMs, serving as proxies for fine-tuning
and facilitating two types of synergies: cloud-local and task-centric. Additionally, we discuss the critical aspect of their
trustworthiness. The paper concludes with key insights aimed at guiding future research on small language models.
